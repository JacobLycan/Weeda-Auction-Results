Unitrade catalogue is $65.00 per set. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

129	Gold Coast #26-35. Rare complete sound used set of 10 of the 1898 to 1902 period Queen Victoria issues, with choice "sock on the nose" CDS cancels on the 5sh and 10sh high values. The particularly elusive 2p value (#28) is in choice quality condition. 2020 Scott US$425.85=	$553.60	$190.00

136	Great Britain #124. Fresh used "Sock on the Nose" oval registered cancel (THREADNEEDLE St. 30 JU '99) example of the 1891 issue £1.00 green Queen Victoria high value, watermarked Imperial Crown. As per Scott footnotes there should be a 25% premium for centering (margins clear of design) and a 25% premium for the CDS cancel ($1,200.00 US). Due to a minute repair to a couple of perfs at left (the repair only visible in fluid), no premiums have been added. 2019 Scott US$800.00=	$1,040.00	$140.00
3634
137	Great Britain #142. Fresh and VF centered used example of the 1902 issue £1 blue green Edward. Note two light "LONDON DE 12 '04 F.S. 15" CDS cancels. All in all an exceptional example of the top value Edward. 2020 Scott US$825.00=	$1,072.50	$290.00

149	Indonesia - Riau Archipelago #1-22. Complete 1954 issue set of 22 mint. The set appears to be Never Hinged but with the (unfortunately common) tropicalized gum.

153	Italy #24/75. Seventy-seven stamps from the 1863-1897 period, including colour varieties identified by the consignor. Most are F/VF and sound, mainly used but with three mint no gum and two MH. Expect the odd minor flaw in the mix. Owner's 2017 Scott US$1,194.40=	$1,194.80	$140.00

Three different volumes from very large consignment consisting of Japan on Vario pages, British Europe in a "Minkus" album, and Ireland on computer generated pages plus 2 accumulations/collections (US and Germany) stuffed into manila envelopes.

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was not included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). The unsevered booklet of thirty is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $57.60. A "sleeper" booklet type and scarce Olympic topical. 2019 Unitrade.	$240.00	$85.00
2626
91	Canada #2080b (BK302Ab). The 50c Flag over Five scenes (#2076-2080) booklet of ten PRINTED ON GUM SIDE.

94	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

8	British Commonwealth - Anguilla/Uganda Stock. Nicely organized and identified dealer stock of 3,065 mint and used stamps from all corners of the British Empire. While the Scott number of every stamp has been determined and the stamps have all been placed in #102 dealer cards, housed in 3 long red dealer boxes, nothing has been priced. Total catalogue value of the entire lot is probably a couple thousand dollars. All that's needed is for the latest catalogue value to be written on the cards (if desired). See the scans of the 3 separate inventory lists to determine the number of stamps per country/colony. Estimate	$300.00	$230.00

The collection begins with a run of most Small Queens, QV Leaf issues, Edwards including Tercentenaries, then GeoV through the end of GeoVI period with a good range of sets in the mix. A decent Back of the Book section rounds out this nicer than average quality collection. This being said expect the odd fault. Accurate 2014 Scott US$5,886.45=	$7,652.39	$450.00

3434
26	Canada #100. Superb and perfectly centered mint full OG very light Hinge example of the 7c olive green "Montcalm and Wolfe" from the 1908 Quebec Tercentenary series. As nice a stamp as you'll find without paying 200% more for NH. Unitrade is $250.00 for VF mint H. 2020 Scott US$160.00=	$208.00	$75.00

45	Canada #468A. CBN "Test Coils". Canadian Bank Note Company 1967 issue test coils in an imperforate strip of four (with DEX gum). These "FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY/AUX FINS D'ESSAI” coils were produced for use with the 6c orange Centennial coils to display the new coil dispensers.

4780
46	Canada #522i VARIETY, 528i VARIETY. VF mint NH examples of the 5c and 6c identical centre blocks from the 1970 Xmas "Childrens' Drawings" issue. Scarce blocks, listed in many catalogues and illustrated in many albums. The 5c block shows only a very faint "split dot" version of the "M.A" variety (#522iii), unlike any example of this variety I've seen to date, either an early state of this plate flaw or a later attempted correction (removal) of the dot. The 6c block is WITHOUT the "scratch through window" variety (much scarcer than a block with the variety and worth a 50% premium as such). Estimate	$100.00	$36.00
5723
47	Canada #582-585. VF mint NH investment group of 15 full mint NH philatelic (untrimmed, with full plate inscriptions and wide selvedge margins) panes of 16 of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant Earth Sciences commemorative. A very high quality selection. 2019 Unitrade.	$525.00	$70.00

The lot consists of #599 x 4 (perf 12.5 x 12.0, plate #2), #600 x 3 (perf 11 x 11, plate #1) and #601 x 5 (plate #1). 2019 Unitrade.	$325.00	$65.00
5198
50	Canada #614a. VARIETY. Superb condition mint NH imperforate pair of the 1973 issue 15c RCMP "Musical Ride" commemorative, with the top stamp in the pair with the Unitrade listed DOUBLE PRINTING. This pair is in perfect and fault-free condition, unlike the majority of imperforates of this issue on the market, which almost always have creases and gum problems. You won't find a nicer pair than this! 2019 Unitrade.	$900.00	$325.00
5614
51	Canada #714/806. VARIETIES. VF MNH variety collection of the 12c blue, 14c red and 17c green "Parliament Building" definitives, consisting of a range of various constant plate varieties, paper fluorescences, tagging errors, perforation shifts and EFOs. A good start to an exhibition-level collection of these popular error-prone issues. Estimate	$250.00	$36.00
3634
52	Canada #839. Printing and Tagging Shift. VF mint NH example of the 1979 Christmas issue 15c "Wooden Train" with the silver "15" & tagging shifted 3mm to the right. The "5" of the denomination appears in right margin & the stamp is also a ONE-BAR TAG ERROR (G2aL) with single bar at left. This variety is listed in Darnell catalogue as #879a. Only two sheets of 50 with this combination error reported. This stamp is from position 18 from sheet #2. Darnell catalogue	$150.00	$46.00
5690
53	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2019 Unitrade.	$400.00	$60.00
329
54	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH example of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed 50c to 52c rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety. 2019 Unitrade.	$200.00	$55.00
4007
55	Canada #1535ii. The rare and unissued 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate change, VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. Issued 88c value included for comparison. 2019 Unitrade.	$600.00	$160.00
3613
56	Canada #1679. PRINTING SHIFT. VF mint NH block of four of the 1999 issue 10c "Woodworking" from the "Traditional Trades" definitive series with a very dramatic PRINTING SHIFT showing the black background shifted right so "10 CANADA" looks DOUBLED. A very interesting variety. We know of only 60 copies in total, all that were saved from one single sheet. Normal stamp included for comparison. Estimate	$100.00	$42.00
5614
57	Canada #1683a. Top quality VF mint NH imperforate pair of the 2000 issue 47c Queen Elizabeth definitive. From a unique sheet found near Elliot Lake Ontario in May 2001 (therefore only 50 pairs). A modern Elizabethan rarity of the highest order. 2019 Unitrade.	$900.00	$260.00
5445
58	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. Priced as four singles. 2019 Unitrade.	$400.00	$90.00
4007
59	Canada #1764b. VF+ MNH example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. See the next lot for an exponentially more elusive inscription block of four. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$140.00
5631
60	Canada #1764b. Handpicked upper left corner VF+ MNH inscription block of four of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known and only a tiny handful of inscription blocks are in existence. Unquestionably one of the rarest modern issue plate blocks. Includes a block of the regular #1764 (perf 13.1 x 13.1) for comparison. 2019 Unitrade.	$2,500.00	$800.00
5793
61	Canada #1767/2194, 2465b, 2467b. Mint NH collection of 1999 to 2006 period issues (plus a couple from 2010), all archivally stored on hingeless pages in the original Lighthouse album, plus the 1999 issue hard cover Millennium collection book. A comprehensive offering of stamps, souvenir sheets and booklets, all conservatively valued as face value postage only but worth a decent premium as a collection. Total face value	$453.83	$290.00
4249
62	Canada #1812, 1812i, 1813, 1813i, 1814, 1814i, 1818-1834, UX125. VF MNH complete run of all the 1999-2000 Millennium miniature sheets including the basic set of 17 panes plus the additional six "Dove" thematic panes of 4 and 1 as well as the postal stationery post card. Total face value of all the stamps is $41.08. Becoming an increasingly difficult group to assemble, let alone complete. 2019 Unitrade.	$200.00	$110.00
1703
63	Canada #1969a. VF mint NH example of the 2003 issue 48c Year of the Ram Lunar New Year stamp with the Unitrade listed MISSING GOLD on Ram's Shoulder error. This eye-catching error comes from a very small group of sheets found in BC. A normal stamp is included for comparison. 2019 Unitrade.	$600.00	$250.00
4791
64	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$85.00
5822
65	Canada #2012. FORGERY. The 2003 issue 49c Queen Elizabeth II POSTAL COUNTERFEIT in a horizontal pair from the original forged booklet pane of 10. An excellent counterfeit that would (and did) certainly fool most postal authorities and collectors. Reportedly created in the Baltic states of Eastern Europe by former intelligence service agents. Estimate	$100.00	$22.00
329
66	Canada #2156. VF mint NH investment lot of 25 examples of a scarce and "overlooked" 2006 Canada/USA co-issue souvenir sheet, commemorating Champlain Surveying the East Coast. The sheet contains 2 x 39c US stamps and 2 x 51c Canadian stamps. This sheet can be distinguished from the US Post Office edition by the bar code in the lower left corner (the US version has no bar code). 2019 Unitrade.	$250.00	$70.00
5595
67	Canada #2201a. VF MNH left-hand sheet margin example of the 52c Year of the Pig Lunar New Year issue with the "Missing Gold" error. Normal stamp included for comparison. I remember selling these for $400.00 when they were first discovered. 2019 Unitrade.	$100.00	$60.00
4791
68	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Five complete VF MNH complete sets (still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2017 Unitrade.	$325.00	$95.00
5641
69	Canada #2844. Recalled Souvenir Sheet. Recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites Souvenir Sheet. VF mint condition example of the rare recalled $8.40 souvenir sheet of five, including one misidentified "Hoodoo" stamp. The entire printing was withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post. The Unitrade catalogue value is irrelevant with regards to the actual market value of the sheet as the recalled souvenir sheet is proving to be much scarcer than the recalled booklet. Estimate	$150.00	$130.00
5233

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was not included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). The unsevered booklet of thirty is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $43.20.

3543

These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the misidentified "Hoodoos" stamps.

5492

A very popular issue with all the regular supplies exhausted by fanatical Trekkies a long time ago (but not in a galaxy far, far away - that's Star Wars). These booklets regularly sell for well over the original issue price of $19.95 each and often sell for the full catalogue value of $40.00 each. 2019 Unitrade.	$400.00	$230.00
4780
79	Canada #BK686. Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. These regularly sell for over full catalogue value. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00

5053
87	Canada #FWH20b. The 2004 issue $8.50 "Mallards" Federal Wildlife Habitat Conservation Stamp in a full VF mint NH sheet of 16 with full marginal inscriptions.

5400
97	Canada #OX4. Attractively centered and F/VF mint NH example of the 1913 issue brown black officially sealed stamp. Very hard to find Never Hinged. Some dealers/auction houses would be tempted to value this stamp as a "split grade" F/VF at $350.00 (VFNH @$600.00 + FNH @$100.00 ÷ 2 = $350.00). 2017 Unitrade as Fine NH.	$100.00	$40.00

99	Canada - 1950s Era Essay. A VF quality imperforate 4c yellow, black, green and red unadopted "Native Indian Head" essay from 1958.

5389
100	Canada - Annual Collection/Souvenir Book Duo. Two scarce but only Fine condition Canada Post books, the first one being the rare "Some Canadian Postage Stamps" dark green hardcover book with embossed gilt text on cover containing MNH blocks of various 1961-1964 period issues. Note that this book is the 1965 revised edition. I don't know why this scarce tome isn't listed in Unitrade. 2005 Darnell lists this book at $50.00 (an unreasonably low price considering how seldom you see these books). Some soiling noted along page edges from handling. The second book is a scarce 1976 Canada Post Annual Collection, containing VF mint NH stamps but with some cover wear. Unitrade catalogue is $85.00 for the yearbook. Estimate	$100.00	$85.00
3543
101	Canada - Annual Collections for 1975 and 1976. Pristine quality Canada Post yearbooks, both in original envelopes. The 1975 and 1976 books are nearly as scarce as the much higher catalogued 1974 issue. 2019 Unitrade.	$170.00	$55.00

104	Canada - BABNC "Baby Sisters" Centennial Era Sample Stamps. Decades old specialized offering of the British American Bank Note Company "Baby Sisters" engraved stamp samples, printed in various colours, perforation combinations and gum types. According to the original dealer handling this material (Gary Lyon Philatelist Ltd.), due to unequal numbers of the various varieties, there are only a very limited number of these lots capable of being prepared. This group consists of six multi-coloured imperf between pairs - two with additional perforated stamps to make eye-catching triptychs. We don't often see the multicolour printings. The lot includes a colour photo of the experimental pane format. A "must have" lot for the QEII Centennial issue specialist. Estimate	$350.00	$400.00

Consists of 229 different stamps in total. These die-cuts are very hard to find as they only came in collector's packs or annual collection albums and were not available over the counter as normal stamps. This format is the only way to get neat looking mint singles with intact backing. 2019 Unitrade.	$652.00	$400.00

Exceptional potential for "finds", particularly for the intrepid UV and magnifier equipped philatelic researcher. HUGE total Unitrade catalogue value (well over $22,000.00!). Conservatively valued as face value postage only. Total Face value	$2,694.00	$1,125.00

Contains a VF MNH set of blocks of #311-314, the Canadian Stamp Centenary issue. Very limited issue and a key addition to any Souvenir Book collection. Only listed (and in our opinion severely underpriced) in the 2005 Darnell catalogue. As an added bonus, the lot includes a set of special cacheted covers, each one carried from Richmond Hill ON by different means (locomotive, helicopter, stagecoach and native runner). Valued as the book only. Undervalued 2005 Darnell catalogue.	$125.00	$50.00

4249
119	Canada Cancels - BRITISH COLUMBIA POSTMARKS – A rather MARVELOUS lot. Many of these items are noted as being under discussion for inclusion in "the next catalogue" as they are presently unlisted. Michael Sagar's MOON 1950-1973 catalogue is included. Many are on #8 fronts, with 40 different closed post offices on the fronts - almost all are "C" for rarity. Hundreds, probably a few thousand more that are not only MOONs but CDS dated. Sub post offices do not offer a rarity factor and there are a few openings of 3 yrs or less (a 1969 Nelson sub 4 and MOON, open less than 1 year; Courtenay Sub 1 open 1971-1972; Surrey Sub 8, open 1969-1971). Here is the possibly unique aspect - there are 18 with special notes attached that speak to the postmarks (mostly MOONs) that look as if they are written maybe by Fred Bailey himself on covers. Some of these are addressed to him, indicating they are unlisted or not known. Includes notes re differences of listed items with side note in red saying, "Mike agrees", with notes such as "New # will be issued" to cover this newfound variety. There is at least one of Arnot's. There are approximately another 100, mostly #8s; on quick view these do not seem to have any rare status. Also 19 black plastic double-sided stock pages with mostly MOON cancels on stamps in sleeves. Finally, a brown envelope with loose stamps with mostly MOONs – a few are closed POs such as "Premier BC". Generally Fine overall. Total of 150+ covers plus a few thousand postmarks on stamps and catalogue with scripted additional notes. The student of this area should find a small treasure here. Estimate	$250.00	$475.00
3841
120	Canada Covers - First Day Cover Motherlode. Banker's box containing 1,264 carefully stored First Day Covers, with issues ranging from 1968 to 1987 plus a couple of more recent FDCs.

5739
121	Canada Covers - Karsh/Wilding Issues. Three volume extensively annotated exhibit/collection of Karsh and Wilding era covers and cards including just about every aspect of Canadian postal history for this time period.

5400
122	Canada Perfins - Three pages containing 277 company/government /private perfin stamps, several in mixed condition. All different in stamp, issuer or pattern, raging from Queen Victoria to Queen Elizabeth II. Perfin factor "F". Owner's estimate	$700.00	$190.00

73	Canada #647a-T1. UNTAGGED ERROR. VF MNH lower right blank corner block of 4 of the 1974 "Keep Fit" Winter Sports COJO Olympic issue, untagged error. Although only one sheet was reported, this block came from the Mike Painter collection where he wrote the following: "My father bought some of this issue at the Okanagan Mission, BC Post Office in 1974. He saved the corner block for me and used the rest as postage including at least four letters to me but I didn't examine them closely until after my father's death in 1980. Since the sheet Ken Rose reported wasn't from Okanagan Mission, I assume my father got all or part of a second sheet from that office." A modern rarity with very few mint untagged corner or inscription blocks reported. Note that the four USED singles Mike Painter describes sold in our August 22nd bidboard sold for $425.00, OVER full Unitrade catalogue value. 2018 Unitrade.	$600.00	$425.00

All mounted on four cut-down black "Nubian" album pages. The stamps are all more or less firmly affixed to the pages due to storage in humid conditions. I would assume that once soaked, apart from having no gum, the material will be sound and include a good number of VF centered stamps (a sweatbox treatment might produce stamps with OG). 2019 Scott US$580.00=	$754.00	$42.00

I would assume that once soaked, apart from having no gum, the material will be sound and include a good number of VF centered stamps (a sweatbox treatment might produce stamps with OG). 2019 Scott US$2,203.00=	$2,863.90	$46.00

84	Canada #522i, 525i, 522pi, 525pi. VF mint "complete set" of all four types of the 5c and 6c identical centre blocks of four of the 1970 Christmas issue. The regular blocks have lightly glazed gum but the tagged blocks have perfect and unblemished NH gum. Of particular note is the fact that the #525pi block does NOT have the "scratch through window variety" and as such is much scarcer (warranting a 50% premium as per Unitrade footnotes). 2018 Unitrade.	$580.00	$130.00

4249
87	Canada #714. DOUBLE PERFORATION ERROR. VF MNH right hand sheet margin block of 20 of the 1977 issue 12c blue Parliament definitive with dramatically shifted and doubled vertical perforations.

Estimate	$500.00	$375.00
5614

4249
90	Canada #1407ai. Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2019 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00
5233
91	Canada #1630ai. VF MNH investment lot of 50 of the 1997 Year of the Ox souvenir sheet of two x 45c Lunar New Year stamps with the additional limited edition "Hong Kong 97" logo printed in lower right corner of the sheet. This is the scarcest (and first) Lunar New Year souvenir sheet. Excellent investment opportunity. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$50.00
5233
92	Canada #1764b. Handpicked sheet margin VF+ MNH example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$210.00
5614
93	Canada #1991C-1991D. Complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheet. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in the sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2019 Unitrade.	$100.00	$50.00
5823
94	Canada #2002, 2067, 2109, 2147, 2211, 2270, 2321, 2395, 2436, 2522. The complete 2003-2012 set of all 10 "Art Canada" commemoratives in VF MNH panes of six or sixteen. This series was the intermediate series between the 1988-2002 "Masterpieces of Canadian Art" and 2013-2017 "Canadian Photography" commemoratives. A difficult group to assemble. Total usable Face value including the Joe Fafard "Permanent" issue is $85.12. 2019 Unitrade.	$204.00	$120.00
4901
95	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly and dog thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. Look for sets to increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2019 Unitrade.	$160.00	$70.00
5725
96	Canada #2844. Souvenir Sheet (+ #2857). Recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites Souvenir Sheet. VF mint condition example of the rare recalled $8.40 souvenir sheet of five, including one misidentified "Hoodoo" stamp. The entire printing was withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post. The Unitrade catalogue value is irrelevant with regards to the actual market value of the sheet as the recalled souvenir sheet is proving to be much scarcer than the recalled booklet. Mint NH example of the revised sheet (#2857) included for comparison. Estimate	$150.00	$150.00
3820
97	Canada #BK5d, BK5f. ENGLISH. Two different VF, pristine, complete and intact English language booklets, each containing two panes of the 2c carmine KGV Admiral (#106a), with small type II text.

100	Canada #BK686. Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. These regularly sell over full catalogue value. Estimate	$150.00	$90.00
5841

3414
94	Canada #544. Full sheet of 100 of the 8c black Centennial with slanted tagging causing the bottom half of the sheet (approximately 50 stamps) to be 1 bar TAG ERRORS. The tagging on the top half barely touch perf tips. F/VF mint NH. Estimate	$300.00	$70.00
5595
95	Canada #1125Ai. The eye-catching and undervalued "black and green inscriptions doubled" error on the 1978 issue "CAPEX '87" souvenir sheet. VF mint NH, on DF/F paper. Scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. 2019 Unitrade.	$75.00	$240.00
2740
96	Canada #1356b. VF mint NH complete booklet pane of 50 (folded) of the 1991 issue 42c "Flag over Hills" definitive (no booklet cover). 2019 Unitrade.	$120.00	$16.00
5038
97	Canada #1696a. VF MNH investment lot of eight full sheetlets of the 1998 issue 45c ATM stamp. This is the first of the two experimental panes (the Post Office also issued a 46c later in the year). The sheetlet is the exact same size as a Canadian banknote. A short lived experiment. Total face value of the panes is $64.80. Difficult sheets to acquire. 2018 Unitrade.	$280.00	$50.00
5822
98	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
982
99	Canada #2116i. VF mint NH compete pane of eight of the 2005 issue 50c self-adhesive "Alberta Centennial", each stamp with the Unitrade listed "missing S-shaped die cut on backing" error. Scanned images show front and back. 2019 Unitrade.	$1,000.00	$375.00
5614
100	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Normal sheet included for comparison. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. 2019 Unitrade.	$194.00	$180.00
5626
101	Canada #2881 (BK 634). Dramatic Error Pane. Complete mint booklet gutter pane of 12 of the 2015 issue "P" rate Christmas/Noel "Moose", with DRAMATICALLY MIS-ALIGNED SERPENTINE DIE CUTS. A rough sketch in red of the die cuts on a photocopy of the pane helps to explain the extreme severity of this slip-up. Previously unrecorded, it is a major modern booklet error of the highest order. Estimate	$750.00	$525.00
4005
102	Canada #BK25. FRENCH. Lovely pristine and VF condition complete and intact French text booklet containing 2 panes of six of the 2c brown KGV Jubilee 1935 issue. The overall condition of the booklet is excellent and the panes inside are top-notch. 2019 Unitrade.	$575.00	$130.00

103	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$60.00
5725
104	Canada #C1-C9, CE1-CE4. Fresh and F/VF MNH complete run of all 9 Airmail and all 4 Special Delivery Airmail stamps, 1928-1946 period issues. The key #C2 is particularly nice. 2019 Scott US$259.85=	$337.80	$70.00
1683
105	Canada #E1-E11. All fresh, sound and pristine mint run of all 11 different 1898 to 1946 period Special Delivery issues. Several stamps in the lot are particularly nice. Note that the #E1 is no gum but the others are all full OG Hinged. 2019 Scott US$456.50=	$593.45	$36.00
4197
106	Canada #E1iv. Archivally fresh, VF+ mint H example of the Unitrade listed deep blue green shade of the 1898 issue 10c Special Delivery. This stamp has been hinged once, then cared for and coddled since that day! A real Special Delivery gem. 2019 Unitrade.	$400.00	$200.00
5809
107	Canada #E2, E2a. Fresh and F/VF mint Hinged duo of 1922 issue 20c Special Delivery stamps, consisting of both the dry (42.5mm) printing in carmine and the much scarcer wet printing in scarlet. The wet printing process results in a design 1.5 mm narrower (41mm) and has a distinctively richer colour. An ideal set for comparison purposes. 2019 Scott Classic US$280.00=	$364.00	$46.00
3414
108	Canada #F2. F/VF mint OG example of the 5c dark green registration stamp. The stamp is probably NH but there are some gum irregularities so the stamp is valued as Hinged. 2019 Scott US$140.00=	$182.00	$75.00
4663
109	Canada #FWH9. Full VF mint NH sheet of 16 of the 1993 issue Federal Wildlife Habitat Conservation Stamp $8.50 Hooded Merganser "Duck Stamp". Much harder to find than the booklet pane. Total face value $136.00. 2019 Unitrade.	$325.00	$44.00

5809
54	Canada #251. DRAMATIC INKING ERROR. VF mint NH lower sheet margin pair of the 3c dark carmine KGVI War Issue with a fabulous "Missing ink" EFO printing error, where (most likely) there was a foreign object that interfered with the transfer of ink onto the plate. Under magnification there is no scraping or disturbance of the paper on the front nor on the gum on the reverse, and the embossing on the gum side from the dry printing method is simply absent where the design is interrupted. An eye-catching pair which could make for a unique centerpiece in an EFO exhibit. Estimate	$200.00	$60.00
99
55	Canada #274/601ii. VF quality mint collection of plate blocks, all neatly laid out on 28 double sided Unitrade brand stock pages.

5198
59	Canada #338iii. VF MNH lot of 3 different plate blocks on the rare vertically ribbed HF paper, 2c green QEII Wilding definitive issue. This lot consists of the lower right position of plate #13 and the upper left and upper positions of plate #14. While not as bright as the "High Fluorescence" designation for other issues in the Unitrade catalogue this is the HF variety for this issue. 2019 Unitrade.	$900.00	$200.00
4841
60	Canada #338iii. VF MNH lot of 4 different plate blocks on the rare vertically ribbed HF paper, 2c green QEII Wilding definitive issue.

5614
61	Canada #340iii. VF MNH lot of 4 different plate blocks from plates #15 and 16 of the 4c violet QEII Wilding definitive issue, which is listed in the Unitrade catalogue as the scarce vertically ribbed HB paper. The actual fluorescence level of these blocks is closer to MF, certainly brighter than "F" but not as bright as the 3c carmine rose "HB" under a UV lamp. In D. Robin Harris' Wilding Definitive handbook the highest fluorescence listed for the 4c violet is HF and these blocks are just a shade less bright than that and the companion lot of #338iii. The fluorescence levels on this issue are notoriously difficult to detect as this was a period of transition to using fluorescent printing papers. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$230.00
4841
62	Canada #340iii. VF MNH lot of 6 different plate blocks consisting of upper right and left positions from plates #15 and a matched set of plate #16 of the 4c violet QEII Wilding definitive issue, that is listed in the Unitrade catalogue as the scarce vertically ribbed HB paper.

Robin Harris' Wilding Definitive handbook the highest fluorescence listed for the 4c violet is HF and these blocks are just a shade less bright than that and the companion lot of #338iii.

4791
73	Canada #1176a. VF MNH full sheet of 50 (with full inscriptions) of the 1990 issue 63c Harbour Porpoise on Peterborough paper in the scarce perf 13.1 x 13.1.

2626

5631
77	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2019 Unitrade.	$800.00	$250.00
5809
78	Canada #1764b. Handpicked sheet margin VF+ MNH example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$425.00

5233

4780
82	Canada #BK686. Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
5233
83	Canada #E3-E11. All fresh, sound and pristine mint NH selection of nine different 1927 to 1946 period Special Delivery issues. The 1935 to 1946 period stamps are particularly nice. Missing only the two earlies to be a complete run. 2019 Scott US$411.25=	$534.63	$70.00
3076
84	Canada #F1c. IMPERFORATE SINGLE. VF used upper left corner IMPERFORATE SINGLE example of the 2c vermilion Registration stamp. No "favour" imperforates of the 2c were produced (unlike the 5c and 8c values) and only one used imperforate pair is recorded. The colour, paper and cancel are consistent with the printing and time period associated with known imperforate pair. The margins at left and top are large enough to validate the imperf theory. Looks OK but still sold "as is". Valued as ½ the value of an imperf pair. 2019 Unitrade.	$2,000.00	$130.00
5614
85	Canada #F2. F/VF mint OG example of the 5c dark green registration stamp. The stamp is probably NH but there are some gum irregularities so the stamp is valued as Hinged. 2019 Scott US$140.00=	$182.00	$85.00

VF+ used examples of the 1c orange MacDonald and 5c violet Laurier 1927 Confederation issues with 5-hole OHMS official perfins in positions C and B respectively, both superbly centered and fault free.

A "must have" lot for the QEII Centennial issue specialist. According to the original dealer handling this material (Gary Lyon Philatelist Ltd.), due to unequal numbers of the various varieties, there were only 24 of these lots capable of being prepared. See the three pages of documentation for the full details on this group. The "special offer" 1998 sale price for this group was $179.00 but most of these original lots have since been broken up.

Scarce blocks, listed in many catalogues and illustrated in many albums. The 5c block shows only a very faint "split dot" version of the "M.A" variety (#522iii), unlike any example of this variety I've seen to date, either an early state of this plate flaw or a later attempted correction (removal) of the dot. The 6c block is WITHOUT the "scratch through window" variety (much scarcer than a block with the variety and worth a 50% premium as such). Estimate	$100.00	$17.00

The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$230.00

5389
90	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$240.00
3909
91	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH.

The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail.

5664
96	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00

5641
99	Canada #E4. Perfectly centered VF MNH example of the 1930 issue 20c henna brown "TWENTY CENTS" Special Delivery stamp.

51	Canada #157 plus Facsimile Proof. A recent (1980s) engraved faked progressive essay of the 20c "Harvester" stamp from the 1928-1929 GeoV Scroll series. The Montreal based individual who produced this particular piece was quite prolific and created numerous different ersatz stamp essays and proofs ranging from early Pence items up through issues from the 1930s. Many unsuspecting collectors purchased (and still purchase) these well executed but none-the-less fantasy items as genuine progressive proofs or essays. The lot also includes a genuine stamp (mint Hinged). A great reference lot. Estimate	$150.00	$24.00
386
52	Canada #158. Fresh and VF mint, perfectly centered VLH example of the 1929 issue 50c Bluenose. No Canadian collection is complete without one of these world-famous high value pictorials.

4410

163
65	Canada #362/585. Brown stockbook containing 85 plate blocks ranging between 1956 and 1972. A spot check concluded most were Never Hinged but not all. Some had been stored with photo corners and the corners had left an impression. Face value is $32.16. 2018 Unitrade.	$346.60	$32.00
1202

5233
68	Canada #422iv. VARIETY. VF MNH example of the double printing of the flowers and on the scarce Fluorescent paper, 5c Manitoba Provincial Flowers and Coats of Arms issue. The double printing is distinct but more closely spaced than illustrated in Unitrade. A nice unlisted "Double variety" stamp, if the stamp multiplying factor applies to the fluorescent paper with the variety, the catalogue value would be $2,500. Estimate	$250.00	$65.00
5614
69	Canada #427ii. Fine/VF centered mint Hinged lower left corner pair of the 1966 issue 5c Newfoundland Pitcher plant from the "Floral Emblems and Coats of Arms" series with distinct separate doubled impression of the red printing in the flowers. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00

4371

1003
72	Canada #550. VARIETY. Mint NH unsevered coil block of 100 of the 8c slate QEII Centennial coil. An unusual and stunning looking multiple, some minor separations noted along a few of the vertical roulettes. This piece will fit an exhibit page quite nicely. Estimate	$150.00	$60.00
5342
73	Canada #621-T1c. VF MNH matched set of plate #1 blocks of the 15c gold 1973 Royal Visit issue, virtually UNTAGGED in error. At first glance looks untagged but upon very close inspection there are very small particles of tagging that can be detected. Also of interest is a vertical background printing smear on the left hand stamps of the right blocks; an untagged sheet of 25 with printing smudge on the fourth column is listed in Robin Harris' Adminware database as tagging error T1c with a retail price of $2,000. 2018 Unitrade (for untagged).	$1,600.00	$190.00
5614
74	Canada #704a. VF mint NH example of the 1977 issue 25c QEII Silver Jubilee Commemorative with the "Missing Silver" error. A key modern error. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,500.00	$325.00
5477
75	Canada #929i, 929. VF mint NH matched set of plate blocks of the Unitrade listed "brown background" variety of the 1983 issue 48c "Cradle" medium-value definitive. Previously thought to be a magenta missing colour error, the colour variety is actually due to an anomaly in the ink used by the printer. A very distinctive error of colour. The lot also includes one VF mint NH plate block the true colour for conclusive comparison. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,005.00	$160.00
4295
76	Canada #1155-1161, 1170-1179. VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks of the basic 1987 "Mammal" definitive issues, 1c to 78c values, all still sealed in the Post Office packaging. A popular series, getting harder and harder to find. 2018 Unitrade.	$379.00	$110.00
4780
77	Canada #1172Ag. VF MNH full sheet of 50 (with full inscriptions) of the 1990 issue 46c Wolverine in the scarce perf 14.4 x 13.8. The Mammal definitive issue is becoming more popular with every passing year and sheets are becoming very hard to find. 2018 Unitrade.	$378.00	$55.00
5038
78	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2018 Unitrade.	$400.00	$55.00

5038
80	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower left position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety inscription block. 2018 Unitrade.	$950.00	$210.00
5631
81	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$230.00
3909
82	Canada #1630ai. VF MNH investment lot of 50 of the 1997 Year of the Ox souvenir sheet of two x 45c Lunar New Year stamps with the additional limited edition "Hong Kong 97" logo printed in lower right corner of the sheet. This is the scarcest (and first) Lunar New Year souvenir sheet. Excellent investment opportunity. 2018 Unitrade.	$500.00	$75.00
3912
83	Canada #1812-1834. The 1999-2000 Millennium miniature sheet set of 17 panes, both VF mint NH and on Canada Post First Day Covers. Total face value of all the mint stamps is $31.28. Becoming an increasingly difficult group to assemble, particularly on FDC. 2018 Unitrade.	$238.00	$60.00
5342
84	Canada #2129iii, 2130iii, 2131iii.

Lot consists of 50 of each of the 89c Yellow Lady’s Slipper, $1.05 Pink Fairy Slipper and $1.49 Himalayan Blue Poppy. Overlooked at first by collectors and most catalogues, these "sleeper" die cuts are sure to be much needed varieties in the future. The total face value as usable postage is $171.50. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,000.00	$130.00
5604
85	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Exceptional investment opportunity consisting of ten complete VF MNH complete sets (all still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2018 Unitrade.	$650.00	$130.00
3613
86	Canada #BK43b (English). Top quality VF investment lot of ten 1950 issue GeoVI "chewing gum" format booklets, each booklet containing one pane of 3 of each 1c green (#284a), 3c rose (#286a) and 4c dark carmine (#287a).

870
87	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$65.00
5233
88	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$70.00
5233
89	Canada #E2a. Fresh and exceptionally well centered VF mint NH example of the scarce 41mm wide wet printing (scarlet shade) of the 1922 issue 20c Special Delivery stamp.

5567
90	Canada #F1. F/VF mint (traces of OG) example of the 1875 issue 2c Registration stamp in a distinctive dull red orange shade. 2018 Scott US$110.00=	$143.00	$80.00

4663
92	Canada #F3. Fresh and Fine mint no gum example of the 1876 issue 8c blue Registration stamp. Sound, rare and attractive. 2019 Scott US$600.00=	$780.00	$130.00

93	Canada #FWH17, FWH22. VF mint NH corner inscription blocks of four of the 2001 ($8.50 Harlequin Duck) and 2005 ($8.50 Harlequin Ducks) Federal Wildlife Habitat Conservation stamps. These more recent issues are much harder to find than the older issues and this scarcity is reflected in the higher catalogue values of the blocks. 2018 Unitrade.	$450.00	$55.00
4425
94	Canada #J13. VF MNH upper right corner sheet margin block of four of the 1933 issue 4c dark violet postage due. Great colour, exceptional centering, perfect gum. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$50.00

5760
116	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #9. Used example of the 5c on 3p perf 14 x 14 bright red "Seal of BC" 1869 issue with light blue (NELSON) cancel. Significant horizontal perf shift (showing part of the adjacent stamp at left). An interesting shift, proving that the 3p stamp was overprinted "5. CENTS. 5" prior to perforating. 2019 Scott US$250.00=	$325.00	$150.00
1174
117	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #11. Used example of the 1869 issue 25 cents on 3p orange "Seal of BC", perf 14 x 14. Sock on the nose "10" numeral cancel in black (William's Creek). A few irregular corner perfs at upper corners noted for the record. 2019 Scott US$325.00=	$422.50	$160.00

4453
120	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #33. Fresh and Fine centered mint no gum example of the scarce 1870 issue 3c vermilion Victoria. Rich deep colour. Small tear in right margin noted for the record. 2019 Scott US$400.00=	$520.00	$30.00
5115
121	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #60i. Exceptionally well centered and VF Jumbo margin mint no gum example of the 1890 issue 3c slate Victoria, on red tinted paper. This was caused by shipwreck seawater soaking the shipment of stamps while on the way to delivery in Newfoundland, the red colouring from the packaging staining the stamps. Needless to say, these almost always come no gum (sometimes traces of OG are found). 2018 Unitrade lists this stamp at $75.00 but it is actually much scarcer (especially in this grade) than the catalogue value would suggest. Estimate	$150.00	$170.00

The listed prices on each card have been taken from an older catalogue and have not been updated in years.

2101
133	Germany #15/1332, B102a. Neatly mounted and annotated mostly used collection of 1,123 stamps and 7 souvenir sheets, 1872-1980 period issues.

See the inventory for list of better items. 2019 Scott US$1,204.75=	$1,566.18	$60.00
5342
134	Germany #49, 51. Post Office fresh, mint NH examples of the 1889 to 1900 period 20pf and 50pf "Imperial Eagle" issues. Both valued as the least expensive shades (but could be the better types). Pristine and unblemished original gum. 2018 Scott Classic US$167.50=	$217.75	$70.00

All fresh and F/VF mint Hinged or used, neatly arranged on the original quadrille album pages. 81 different stamps total. While there is no toning noted, a number of the stamps in this lot have adhered to the pages due to storage in humid conditions. Many of the stuck down mint stamps could be removed from the pages by rolling each page on a table edge or by soaking them off (removing the gum completely). 2018 Scott US$773.45=	$1,005.49	$60.00
5189
136	Germany #C57-C58. Mint NH examples of the 1936 issue 50pf dark blue and 75pf dull green "Hindenburg" airmails, in corner blocks of four and singles. The gum is unblemished and undisturbed, which is scarce but "bad news" because the gum contains a good amount of sulfuric acid which eventually destroys the paper. These are already beginning to show signs of acidification and there is some minor perf separation. Washing off the gum will neutralize the problem. 2019 Scott for Mint no Gum $195.00=	$253.50	$36.00
5189
137	Germany - Definitives and Officials. Blue stockbook containing hundreds of nicely organized duplicated mint and used 19th to mid-20th century definitives and Officials, all identified and valued by 2006 Michel catalogue.

4475
140	Great Britain #1, 5, 6, 109. Decent looking but all faulty used quartet of 1840 to 1884 high value Classics. The #1 has a nick out of the right side, the #5 and #6 both have the commonly occurring paper splits along the vertical silk thread lines and the Sock on the Nose CDS cancelled #109 has a tear at lower right. Huge catalogue value and actually not an unattractive group. 2018 Scott Classic US$3,270.00=	$4,251.00	$150.00
5242
141	Great Britain #4/290. Massively valuable used collection of Victoria to George V issues neatly laid out on 17 double sided Vario pages. Heavier duplication in the "Kings" period.

5342
142	Great Britain #4/125. All used collection of 1841 to 1900 period all Queen Victoria issues, all mounted on nicely designed computer generated pages.

Expect a few faults in the group as well as some minor 19th century "gems". Estimate	$250.00	$400.00
3266
143	Great Britain #94, 95, 96, 109. Pretty showing of four 1883-1884 Queen Victoria used stamps. The 2sh6p lilac is a perfin and the 10sh ultra has a "Telegraphs" cancel. 2019 Scott US$1,015.00=	$1,319.50	$85.00
3266
144	Great Britain #98-105, 107. Nearly complete used 1883-1884 set (missing only the 9p value), all superior quality lightly cancelled examples with much fresher than usual colours. The #99 is a private perfin. Many of the values still have vestiges of the original envelopes on the back, which means that they have never been soaked (thus the full original colour). 2019 Scott US$1,207.00=	$1,569.10	$85.00
4485
145	Great Britain #127/951. All used 1901 to 1981 period collection of EdwardVII, GeoV, EdwardVIII, GeoVI and QEII issues, all laid out on nicely designed computer designed pages.

Expect more of these lots in future sales as we process material from the huge GB consignment we're handling. 2019 Scott US$3,600.00=	$4,680.00	$110.00
4475
