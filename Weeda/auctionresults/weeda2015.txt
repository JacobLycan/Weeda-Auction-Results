It is theorized that this cancelling device was very annoying to use so the postal employees in the Victoria post office "misplaced" it after only a week or so of use. This is the "Holy Grail" of Canadian slogan/flag cancels. Ex Alex Price. Coutts catalogue for the cancel on cover.	$850.00	$850.00

117	Canada Cancels - Superb quality "Sock on the Nose" strike of the rare #627 four-ring numeral cancel, struck on a 10c red lilac Prince Albert "First Cents" issue.

103	Canada Cover - #18 on folded letter from young John Molson, in Montreal, Quebec to the elder John Molson in London, England. Complete handwritten letter, very legible, on embossed envelope paper headlined Molson's Brewery and Distillery and dated January 13, 1865. It arrived, via Canadian Steamer, in London Feb. 1, 1865 and by handwritten note was forwarded to Rome where it was received on Feb. 7, 1865. The letter includes details on staffing at the Brewery plus a very interesting paragraph on a company of [presumed] riflemen, that the elder Molson had sponsored, were invited to the armoury and were requested to take the oath of allegiance, which most of them refused! One assumes, perhaps, that this was occasioned by the fact that Canada was about to become a Country, on its own, and, as today, this engendered considerable antipathy towards the Monarchy. The stamp is in good condition and is perf. 12 x 11¾, likely printed in the latter half of 1864. Based on overall condition, plus historical and topical (brewery) value we estimate the retail value at $500.00. Estimate	$500.00	$220.00

Good upside for the Hong Kong student. 2015 Scott US$1,947.55=	$2,434.44	$210.00
3223
164	Hong Kong #245 // 252, 329 // 364. VF mint, all NH except for #252, selection of 37 different stamps, 1968 to 1980 period issues, all complete sets. A clean and attractive offering. 2015 Scott US$139.85=	$174.81	$32.00

As intact booklets these catalogue £650.00 = $1,231.00 CDN. The stamp panes themselves are not hard to find (they are actually just trimmed sheet stock); it's the covers that are rare. Excellent material for exhibition as exploded booklets or worthy candidates for "reconstitution". The lot also includes a couple of panes and part panes between stapled glassine interleaves.

VF mint hinged left hand and right hand examples of the 1919 issue Army of the Northwest overprinted 1 ruble pale brown, dark brown & orange and the 10 rubles scarlet, yellow and grey large format high values, both with printed se-tenant labels, also overprinted. These stamps were used by General Nicolai N. Yudenich and his anti-Bolshevik Army of the Northwest in 1919. Very short period of use as the Army of the Northwest did not fare very well. All four pieces conservatively valued by Scott as basic stamps only but certainly worth much more if valued by any European catalogue. 2015 Scott US$200.00=	$250.00	$110.00

Very wide ranging mint and (mostly) used collection of over 18,600 stamps housed in 3 volumes of Europe, 3 volumes of Asia and 2 volumes of South America. Also saw a handful of covers/postal stationery. Loose stamps within the pages and the spring has sprung on the springback albums so be prepared when you open the books. Well worth the estimate which may even be on the low side. Loads of interesting stamps - saw Queen Victoria Hong Kong, used China, some Western European countries represented and quality seems Fine for the most part. Estimate	$600.00	$775.00

This particular proof pair was part of a "Canadian Stamp Investors Corporation" portfolio offered in April 1982 and sold to the investor for $786.40 (1982 dollars).

5322
14	Canada #13. Decent looking used example of the 1859 issue perforated 6 penny brown violet Albert. Usual pen cancel, expertly repaired at left. A more than acceptable "budget valued" example of this major rarity. 2015 Scott US$7,500.00=	$9,000.00	$1,325.00

5342
17	Canada #14 // 47. Duplicated (heavy in places) selection of early Canadian Queen Victoria issues. A few mint but mostly used with LOTS of faulty.

19	Canada #15 (x 2), 17b, 19 (x 2), 20, 46. Used selection of 1859-1893 period Queen Victoria issues. Includes #15iii (thick paper variety) $90.00 in Unitrade as VG but counted here by Scott as a regular stamp (US$37.50). The first #15 in the scan has almost imperceptible inscription on left perf tips, also counted as normal stamp. 2015 Scott US$1,020.00=	$1,224.00	$130.00
386
20	Canada #30iii. The famous "Pawnbroker" constant plate variety (position 10) on a very dark grey shade of the 15c Large Queen. VF+ used appearance, 5mm tear at bottom. The light cancel is well clear of the variety (at lower right). Valued as VF used for the variety in the most common paper, perf and shade. 2015 Unitrade.	$600.00	$160.00
5322
21	Canada #33. Used example of the 1868 issue 3c Large Queen on the rare horizontally laid paper. Bright and F-VF, light partial duplex cancel. Very well centered for this issue. One slightly pulled perf at left and a small corner crease upper right (not visible from the face) noted for the record. A most acceptable example of this delicate and elusive Large Queen paper type. 2015 Scott US$2,250.00=	$2,700.00	$825.00
5322
22	Canada #34 // 45b. Solidly researched basic printing and colour study of the well-known and popular 1870-1897 Small Queen series. The stamps are all sound and generally in F/VF condition. Includes a number of perf 11½ types. Nothing beats seeing these shades "in the flesh". 45 stamps in total, running from the ½c to 10c values. A useful group for the budding Small Queen student. Estimate	$350.00	$475.00
3738
23	Canada #34 // 47. Carefully laid out selection of used Small Queen issues on three Hagner stocksheets, ½c to 50c values. The owner has tried to arrange the various values in the proper shade order. Includes dated stamps, Squared Circles and some very nice items. Expect the odd overlooked small fault in the priced stamps. Two rows of unpriced stamps on the last stocksheet are also included in the lot. A very useful group for the Small Queen student. See the scan of the owner's inventory and description for the full story on this lot. Owner's 2015 Unitrade $2,370.45=	$2,844.54	$290.00
3223
24	Canada #35 // 77, F1. Neatly mounted, illustrated and annotated study of mostly late Victorian era stamps and cancels. 390 stamps in total, with #77 accounting for 286 of this number. Noted shades, papers and dies with regards to the stamps but much of the interest lies in the cancels which includes CDS towns, Flags, RPOs, Corks, Parcel Post and Registration cancels. A nice old-time holding, ready to be seen by new eyes and prime for re-organizing. Estimate	$300.00	$95.00
3266
25	Canada #35i. A perfect VF MNH 1888 bright yellow (Montreal) printing of the 1c Small Queen (perf 12 x 12.25). 2015 Unitrade.	$300.00	$200.00
5322
26	Canada #35viii. VF used example of the 1c yellow Small Queen with the rare and popular "strand of hair" plate variety (plate C, right pane, position 13). The variety stamp is the right hand stamp in the strip of three. The "strand" is very strong and noticeable. Note that the vertical perfs in this strip are very weak and will most likely become single stamps with handling. 2015 Unitrade.	$600.00	$180.00
5322
27	Canada #36 // 468A, C6 // C9, CE1-CE2, E9-E11. F1, O1 // O38. Decent quality remaindered dealer's stock of 1920s to 1960s period issues, almost all mint H/NH, all in #102 style dealers cards stored in a small counter book.

4818
28	Canada #36 Re-entry, 41vi, 41 Plate Flaw, 36 & 41a Imperf Singles. An intriguing and carefully assembled quintet of used Small Queen varieties and anomalies. The only Unitrade priced item is the "Vampire Bite" plate flaw (#41vi), at $150.00 for Fine Used (short perfs at left) but the other stamps have very prominent and legitimate varieties as noted by the fastidious collector. The #36 re-entry, while not "the" Major Re-entry is nonetheless a major re-entry as noted by Ralph Trimble. The #41 with neck scratches also has pitting in other areas of the design. The two imperforate singles, while impossible to certify, both have margins large enough to make one wonder why anyone in their right mind would have removed these from the covers they were on. A fantastic group for the ardent Small Queen admirer. Estimate	$250.00	$160.00
3942
29	Canada #36x. Used example of the 2c Small Queen, perf 11.9 x 12 with a VERTICAL STITCH WATERMARK right down the middle of the stamp.

5322
30	Canada #37d. Sound, fresh and Fine used example of the 1870 issue 3c Small Queen, copper red shade, perf 12½ x 12½. A very presentable example of this rare Small Queen printing.

5322
31	Canada #37vi. Used example of the 3c orange red (early printing, high quality wove paper) Small Queen, perf 11.9 x 12 with a VERTICAL STITCH WATERMARK at right. A sound and VF quality Small Queen rarity, only recently added as a listing in the Unitrade catalogue. If you need this for your Small Queen collection, don't hesitate, as it will probably be a long time before you see another. The Unitrade valuation is for Fine used condition, this one is nicer. 2015 Unitrade as Fine.	$600.00	$550.00
4247
32	Canada #43. VF mint VLH example of the 6c red brown Small Queen. Great fresh colour and centering. Unitrade is $300.00 for VF MH. 2015 Scott US$240.00=	$288.00	$75.00

5322
48	Canada #85. Extremely fresh and F/VF MNH example of the 1898 issue 2c Xmas Map stamp, black and carmine with rich lavender oceans. Good examples of the true lavender shade are very scarce, as the lavender ink is very prone to oxidization and fading. 2015 Scott US$90.00=	$108.00	$55.00
4510

128	Canada Covers - Rare and VF condition WWI "Perkins Bull Hospital" (for Convalescent Canadian Officers) cover, sent January 1918 from Putney Heath, England to Victoria BC. A key piece of Canadian WWI Military postal history. Knowledgeable collectors appreciate how elusive covers from this particular hospital are, as the hospital did not give hospice to a large number of military men during the short course of its existence. Numbered among the convalescent Officers that did spend time at Perkins Bull Hospital were the likes of Billy Bishop and George Vanier. Superb strike of the oval blue hospital postmark. Estimate	$100.00	$85.00
3343

72	Canada #468Ac. Used imperforate strip of three of the 1969 issue 6c orange Centennial coil (DF paper). The bottom pair is perfect VF+ used with a 1969 dated Clermont PQ cancel but noted for the record there is a horizontal crease in the margin between the top stamp and middle stamp in the strip.

VF mint NH 1977 to 1987 period collection of 374 stamps, 9 souvenir sheets/miniature panes and 2 booklets, all laid out in a top of the line Lindner hingeless album containing pages for the years 1977 to 1987. The empty album and pages alone retail for over $150.00. Conservatively valued as face value postage only. Total face value	$139.80	$120.00
3912
77	Canada #714a, 715a. The 1977 issue 12c blue Parliament and the 1978 issue 14c red Parliament, both VF MNH and both PRINTED ON THE GUM SIDE. Very rare modern error duo. 2014 Unitrade.	$450.00	$210.00

3820
80	Canada #934. Printing Shift VARIETY. VF mint NH right sheet margin example of the $1.00 Glacier National Parks high value definitive with a major printing shift error. This causes a "completely missing $1 denomination" error and the word "CANADA" to appear at the centre of the stamp instead of at the far right. This "missing $1" error could only have come from the right hand row in the sheet and is thus much scarcer than the shifts in the other rows. Ex. Escobar estate. Estimate	$250.00	$230.00
5024
81	Canada #1378 // 2196. VF mint NH 1996 to 2010 period collection of 458 stamps, 69 souvenir sheets/miniature panes and 15 booklets/booklet panes, all laid out in two top of the line Lindner hingeless albums with matching slipcases, containing pages for the years 1996 to 2006.

5233
84	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2015 Unitrade.	$800.00	$450.00
3240
85	Canada #1693ii. Full VF MNH pane of four of the 2003 issue $5.00 Moose high value "Wildlife" definitive with strong offset of the brown Moose on the gum side. Unitrade catalogue notes that only 200 examples of this variety are recorded and does not list a price for a full pane (has to be worth a premium). A great eyecatching modern variety showpiece from an increasingly popular series. 2014 Unitrade as four singles.	$600.00	$160.00
4007
86	Canada #1695a. VF MNH imperforate pair of the 1998 issue 46c red Flag coil. This is the last value of the flag coil series. 2015 Unitrade.	$225.00	$80.00

The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued "sleeper" items to be sure! 2015 Unitrade.	$156.00	$150.00
5271
88	Canada #1971. Mini-investment lot of fifteen VF mint NH 2003 issue 48c NHL All Stars souvenir sheets. Total face value of the sheets is $43.20 but these always wholesale for considerably more than face value. This is second scarcest of the NHL All Stars sheets. 2015 Unitrade.	$292.50	$75.00

3569
93	Canada #F1 (x 17), F1b, F2, F3. Very mixed condition selection of mint OGH/disturbed gum Registration stamps, all laid out on one Hagner stocksheet.

5290

4247
101	Canada #O29. Dramatic Misperf. Eyecatching mint NH example of the 4c vermilion GeoVI "G" overprinted Official, misperforated so badly so as to show portions of four different stamps. Errors of this type on overprinted issues are much scarcer than on stamps that have not been overprinted. A great little "Back of the Book" showpiece. Unitrade catalogue (in the introductory section) values an unoverprinted stamp similar to this one at $100-$125. The "G" overprint on this stamp moves it up into a much more valuable category. Estimate	$160.00	$160.00
5024

4614

4071
105	Canada #OA199, OA200. VF used examples of the 5c blue and 8c orange KGV Medallion issues, both with the 5-hole OHMS official perfins. Note the "missing pin in S" variety on the 8c value. 2015 Unitrade.	$267.00	$240.00

High quality modern mixes like this (includes stamps as recent as Flowers, Famous Canadians, CFL, NHL Team Jerseys, Mental Health & Community Foundation semi-postals, Empress of Ireland, Royal Ontario Museum, NFB, UNESCO World Heritage sites, Canadian Photography, Tommy Hunter, Museum of Human Rights, etc.) are becoming increasingly difficult to find.

Recent FDCs are hard to find as they are not issued in as large quantities as older issues. Almost all individually sleeved and priced. Note that the Unitrade catalogue value is low compared to the face value due to the fact that there are numerous FDCs with plate blocks (the Chung/Narbonne catalogue value will be much higher). The total face value of the stamps on cover is $207.83. 2014 Unitrade.	$312.15	$75.00
