3	Australia - Mostly used stock of many hundred stamps, from early Kangaroos and George Heads up to late GeoVI period material. Heavy duplication of some items noted but there is great potential here to find better watermarks, plate varieties and cancels, especially in the earlies. While originally the stamps were probably neatly laid out on the pages, they became a bit jumbled in transit from the consignor to our offices. A fabulous opportunity for the Australian specialist and flyspecker. Estimate	$200.00	$95.00
3223
4	Austria #2 // 26. F/VF used selection of 23 different high quality Austrian earlies. All laid out on one small stocksheet. Owner notes no damaged. May be better cancels. 2014 Scott US$476.40=	$524.04	$48.00

5322
14	Canada #7. VF appearing used example of the 1855 issue 10p Cartier imperforate on thin wove paper. Four huge margins and light cancels but there is a bit of surface scuffing and the margins may have been expertly "enhanced". Ex. Escobar estate. 2015 Scott US$1,750.00=	$1,925.00	$180.00
5322
15	Canada #13. Faulty used example of the 1858 issue perforated 6p Albert. An excellent spacefiller for your collection until you find (and can afford) better. Ex. Escobar estate. 2015 Scott US$7,500.00=	$8,250.00	$2,275.00

86	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper left position plate block of four of the unissued 1994 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A rare modern variety.

5197
88	Canada #2357iii. VF mint NH complete uncut press panel of 100 of the Striped Coralroot "P" Permanent self-adhesive serpentine die cut coil. These uncut panes were printed in September 2010 in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. A very scarce modern variety, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The pricing in the 2014 Unitrade is not particularly consistent regarding this variety since the catalogue value total for 50 imperf between pairs (#2357iv) is $200.00 while a full (and much scarcer) sheet is valued at a lower price. The present face value of this sheet is $85.00. The Unitrade value was established when the rate was only 57c. This sheet is a real sleeper item, sure to go up in value with the new catalogue. 2014 Unitrade for the sheet of 100.	$140.00	$160.00

It is believed that these covers addressed to Roessler never flew, which may have been the case. The company did have a contract to carry the mail although there was no permission to surcharge the mail with their own postage. Therefore a legitimate use of this stamp on cover does not exist.

The cover is endorsed "Via Suspension Bridge" referring to the post office on the US side but this nicely shows the route which would have had this cover crossing over the bridge roughly 6 months after it opened. Included is a US FDC for the centenary of the bridge. Estimate	$100.00	$22.00
3634
122	Canada Covers - Stampless Trans-Atlantic Treasure Trove.

The mail was then carried from Penetanguishene along the north shore of Lake Huron by Dog Team or Men in Snow Shoes to Sault Ste Marie (Postmaster General Report 1858). Of interest it is noted that the men who carried the mail via snow shoe made the trip twice a month and were paid Â£20 per return trip. The 1851 cover was rate 2s3d currency for the rate of carrying a letter 901-1000 miles. In March 1851 the rate was reduced to 3d and the 1852 cover was sent at this rate. Scarce Pair, reunited after being separated over 20 years ago. Estimate	$400.00	$210.00

7	Australian States - South Australia - SPECIMENS. Mounted collection of 47 different 1881 to 1894 period stamps, all overprinted "REPRINT" or "SPECIMEN". All have been affixed to a large printed sheet (which probably dates from the late 1800s). The stamp colours are all quite fresh and there is no toning but a few stamps have visible perf faults. As they are still glued to the original sheet, I assume that they are not thinned but I haven't viewed the backs. Stanley Gibbons catalogue notes Specimen and Reprint items from this period but has no valuation for them. Probably catalogues quite a bit using an Australian specialized catalogue.
