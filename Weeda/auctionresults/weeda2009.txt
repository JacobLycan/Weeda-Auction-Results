4557
132	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #1 (possibly #1c). Faulty used example of the 1861 issue 2p dull rose (perf 9) apparently imperforate on both sides. Faults consist of the all too common thins associated with this delicate paper but the side margins are huge and undeniably genuine. An imperforate between pair catalogues US $3,000.00. Catalogued as a regular #1 by Scott. 2010 Scott US$300.00=	$330.00	$120.00

137	Estonia #142a, 147a, B39a, B44a. MNH quartet of 1938-1939 period commemorative and semi-postal souvenir sheets. These sheets were all printed in very limited quantities (between 32,000 and 57,000 of each) and needless to say became "dead country" issues as soon as thre Russians arrived. The recent resurrection of Estonia has created a demand for these sheets. 2010 Scott is US $100.00 but for hinged sheets. 2003 Michel for MNH is 280 euros=	$448.00	$100.00

MNH showpiece sheet margin blocks of ten of the 1922 issue "Nurse and Wounded Soldier" perf 13.5 x 14 semi-postals, each block containing one vertical pair which is imperforate horizontally. Scott does not price these as MNH. Michel lists them as #29A, 30A, 29AUw, 30AUw at 300 euros for the blocks = $480.00 CDN. Some minor perf separation in selvedge does not detract from this elusive positional piece. 2010 Scott US$100.00=	$110.00	$36.00
4612
139	Estonia #B32-B35, B36-B39, B41-B44, B45-B49. Archivally fresh, VF MNH quartet of 1937-1940 issue "Coats of Arms" semi-postal sets. Fewer than 40,000 of any of these sets issued. 2003 Michel cat for MNH 196 euros= $313.60 CDN. 2010 Scott US$145.00=	$159.50	$85.00

Lots of great WWII thematics. The later WWII semi-postals are very hard to find used. 2010 Scott US$121.20=	$133.32	$32.00
3111
144	Germany - Early post WWII selection of over 220 different mint and used stamps, souvenir sheets, booklet panes and a few covers/cards, 1945-1953 period issues.
