8	British Commonwealth - Old time collection of 927 stamps mounted on pages in a spring-back album suitably named “The Favorite Philatelic Album”. Nothing in here newer than 1940! The album opens with Great Britain with catalogue numbers ranging from #3/248 + BOB material. The GB of note is a seemingly unchecked group of 144 perforated Penny Reds, a decent example of #57, a 5sh Edward (with paper adhered to the back), #173-175 (unchecked for types), mint blocks of George VI & Edward VIII. Colonies include (number of stamps in brackets) Transvaal(17), Ceylon(57), Mauritius(13, inc #10 mint pair), Australia(36), Nyasaland(8), Jamaica(28), Rhodesia(16), Egypt(81), Palestine(17), India & States(72), Ascension(1), Antigua(1), Gibraltar(12),Gold Coast(10), Cyprus(11), Queensland(21), Tasmania(8), S.Australia(12), New South Wales(34), W.Australia(16), Borneo(21), Omnibus Issues(64), New Zealand(58), Malaya(15), Malta(15), Hong Kong(8), Strait Settlements(15), Bermuda(6), Nigeria(5), Cape of Good Hope(9), Zanzibar(3), Trinidad & Tobago(7) & KUT(11). Expect some faults throughout (including cut close earlies), but this should prove to be a rewarding lot for someone that will take the time to disassemble it. Estimate =	$500.00	$290.00
2299
9	British Guiana #43. Sound and VF used example of the 1862 issue rouletted typeset 4c black (on blue paper). The "initialization" signature is both attractively light and legibly clear, by far nicer than we usually see on this often faulty and unattractive stamp. The stamp comes with a 2018 APS photo certificate which states "genuine in all respects". As an extra bonus, the "comet" owner's mark on the reverse allows us to trace the provenance of this particular stamp to the collection of Frederic T. Small, former owner of the famous British Guiana "Penny Magenta", the world's most valuable stamp. 2021 Scott US$1,100.00=	$1,375.00	$475.00
6087
10	British Indian Ocean Territory #1/53. VF MNH lot of 1968-73 issues in blocks of 4, from the 'B.I.O.T.' overprinted Seychelles issues up to Easter 1973. Many in corner and inscription plate blocks of four. 2021 Scott US$196.60 =	$245.75	$36.00

5557

Comes with a clean Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states (in part) "...used, genuine in all respects". An attractive fault-free multiple of this elusive classic Canadian "First Issue" with the best paperwork you could hope for. 2021 Scott US$2,000.00=	$2,500.00	$900.00
4786
13	Canada #7. Moderately cancelled but faulty (thinned) used example of the 1855 issue 10p blue Jacques Cartier imperf on thin crisp paper. Still an attractive pence era item that can be "upgraded" later. 2021 Scott US$1,600.00 =	$2,000.00	$170.00
5070
14	Canada #8. Very faded pen cancelled used example of the 1857 half penny rose Queen Victoria imperforate pence issue. No margins to speak of but otherwise sound. Fill the space, upgrade later. 2022 Scott US$700.00=	$875.00	$70.00
6180
15	Canada #12. Sound mint 1858 issue perforated 3p Beaver. The gum is probably not OG and the stamp has VG centering (don't forget that these were the first attempts at perforating Canadian stamps). All in all a very reasonable and acceptable mint example of this very short usage and extremely rare transitional pence item. Not more than a handful of mint examples of this stamp exist. 2021 Scott US$17,500.00=	$21,875.00	$1,100.00
6108
16	Canada #14/680 plus Back of the Book. All used 1859 to 1975 period collection of over 380 different stamps, all mounted on Stanley Gibbons album pages. No Pence, Large or Small Queens, Jubilees or Quebec Tercentenary issues but noted Leafs, Numerals and EdwardVII sets, then a nearly complete run of of GeoV, GeoVI and QEII issues up to and including 1975. A perfect "running start" to a nice used Canada collection. 2022 US$2,511.75=	$3,139.69	$170.00
6112
17	Canada #22/27. Used selection of Large Queens, all laid out on one Hagner stocksheet. All of the stamps have been identified for perforation and paper types. Expect faults in a group like this but still a well researched reference group for the Large Queen student. 2022 Scott US$1,800.00=	$2,250.00	$230.00
4197
18	Canada #22a. Sound, fresh and Very Fine used example of the 1c brown red Large Queen on Bothwell watermarked paper. Shows the full "W" and part of the "H" of the watermark.

4247
20	Canada #35. Perfectly centered and fresh VF centered mint full OG NH example of the 1c yellow Small Queen. Light natural gum wrinkles noted for the record. Still a nice start to a Never Hinged set of these classic Canadian issues. Unitrade is $180.00 for VF mint NH. 2021 Scott Classic for NH US$100.00=	$125.00	$90.00
6092
21	Canada #35/590. plus Back of the Book. Small elongated Monarch Men's Hosiery box (13½" x 4½" x 3") packed with glassine envelopes containing sorted and semi-sorted selections of mostly used Canada, 1880s to 1960s period issues. Saw some decent cancel interest, higher values, precancels and almost certainly the lot is unchecked for plate varieties or shades. Nice basic catalogue value (well over $1,200.00) and there is good potential upside for the patient sorter. Estimate	$200.00	$90.00
6100
22	Canada #37d. Sound, fresh and Fine used example of the rare 1870 issue 3c copper red, perf 12½ x 12½ Small Queen. Light/moderate cancel, full perfs all around.

6092

Generally Fine/VF mint OG Hinged/HR (20c is no gum) part set of 11 different 1897 issue Queen Victoria Jubilees, consisting of the ½c black up to and including the 50c ultramarine value.

3811
26	Canada #51-54. Fresh and generally F/VF, all mint NH quartet of 1897 issue QV Jubilees, consisting of the 1c orange, 2c green, 3c bright rose and 5c deep blue. A good start to a NH set of Canada's first commemoratives. 2022 Scott US$412.50=	$515.63	$95.00

649

Note the mint Bluenose has a couple of small thins. The face value of the mint postage exceeds $95 and has contributed to the catalogue value at a very conservative 25c per stamp. 2020 Scott US$1665.25 =	$2,081.56	$130.00
5977
36	Canada #66-73. Sound mint OG Hinged 1897 to 1898 Queen Victoria "Leaf" set of eight complete. A good mint "starter" set. The 10c high value is Never Hinged but has some pencil note indentations on the gum side. All valued as Hinged. 2022 Scott US$1,445.00=	$1,806.25	$210.00

Fresh and F/VF mint NH particularly clear example of the MAJOR RE-ENTRY (position 18) on the 1898 issue ½c black QV "Numeral", lower stamp in a se-tenant pair with a normal stamp at top. The sheet margin confirms the position. Conservatively valued as Fine NH only, even though many dealers would be tempted to value it as an "F/VF split grade" at $335.00 due to the huge premium that VF NH adds. 2021 Unitrade =	$160.00	$140.00
4410
40	Canada #75/83. Eight different values from the 1898 to 1902 QV "Numeral" series, all F/VF mint OG Hinged (often LH). Includes both dies of the 2c carmine. Noted a few very nice stamps in this group. 2022 Scott US$1,125.00=	$1,406.25	$220.00

Previously thought to be a magenta missing colour error, the colour variety is actually due to an anomaly in the ink used by the printer. Includes a 2008 VGG certificate with the stated opinion "partially missing the magenta shade" - a historical artifact of this intriguing issue. Estimate	$150.00	$65.00
870

6012

Sensational VF MNH lot of matched sets of plate blocks in sealed packs, 32c Jacques Cartier 1984 issue on F, HF and DF paper and all showing the 'Anchor line' variety between positions 2 and 7.

Conservatively valued as sets of plate blocks only. 2021 Unitrade =	$253.00	$130.00
5427
95	Canada #1160a. VF MNH matched set of blank corner blocks (no inscription blocks issued), 10c Skunk February 1991 Mammal definitive printing on Slater paper, perforated 13.1 x 12.8. 2021 Unitrade =	$300.00	$250.00

870
102	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate -	$450.00	$200.00
5847
103	Canada #2201a. The 2007 issue 52c "Year of the Pig" missing gold error in VF MNH condition. This was that year's major error. We have seen these sell on eBay for up to $900.00 US each (back in the day). Normal stamp included for comparison. 2021 Unitrade =	$100.00	$65.00
5726
104	Canada #2405i. Uncut press sheet of 9 panes of 2 of the $10 Blue Whale definitive in original tube, the October 2010 issue of the highest value even released by Canada Post.

4347
105	Canada #2844. Choice and exceptionally hard to find, a July 7, 2015 usage of the quickly recalled 2015 UNESCO souvenir sheet with the first $1.20 stamp showing an incorrect image of "Hoodoos" instead of Dinosaur Provincial Park, AB. The error was noted soon after the July 3 issue date and all related products were recalled on July 7. Perfectly preserved on piece with boxed Vancouver cancels. The Unitrade catalogue value is tentative as the market hasn't settled on these yet. 2021 Unitrade =	$250.00	$550.00
6108
106	Canada #2844. Rare VF MNH complete souvenir sheet of 5 of the quickly recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Canada showing an image of "Hoodoos" instead of Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta on the first $1.20 stamp. This is proving to be far more elusive than the booklet - see previous lot for an even rarer contemporary usage. The Unitrade catalogue value is tentative as the market hasn't settled on these yet. 2021 Unitrade =	$200.00	$180.00
5233
107	Canada #2847a, BK623, BK628. Hoodoos Booklets. Two July 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six $1.20 stamps each include two of the misidentified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. Also includes the corrected August 2015 issue booklet showing the actual Dinosaur Provincial Park. This booklet trio will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoos" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate =	$150.00	$80.00
6180
108	Canada #2912ii, 2922i, 2983i. VF set of all 3 uncut press sheets for the 2016 and 2017 Star Trek issues, in original tubes. Two of the issues have a layout with multiples of the souvenir sheet, and the lenticular printing sheet (with 3D image) has 12 panes of 2 of the $5 high values. Original issue price was $208.20, since then the face value has risen to $221.04. 2021 Unitrade =	$420.00	$190.00
4179
109	Canada #3129i. Mint condition uncut press sheet with 9 panes of 4, $4 Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep 2018 issue. Only 1,200 press sheets produced. Total face value of the useable high value postage is $144. 2021 Unitrade =	$300.00	$100.00

Also included in the box is a "Compliments of Canada Post" folder containing both FDCs for the issue as well as 3 complete booklets (BK710-BK712) and a mint souvenir sheet #3132, for a total face value of $484.26. 2021 Unitrade =	$938.85	$325.00

5596
112	Canada #BK63b. The 1970 issue "OPAL" Centennial booklet with the rare cross-perforated gutter pane #455ai. VF mint with the usual blemished tab from gluing. From an impeccable source. 2021 Unitrade =	$300.00	$80.00

Each booklet has a different numbered reverse (1 to 24) featuring a different "Did you know?" Olympic fact and photograph. An insanely difficult group to assemble with a total present day face value of $220.80. The Unitrade catalogue value of a complete set is ridiculously low considering how seldom we see sets of these booklets. 2021 Unitrade for 24 basic individual booklets =	$404.00	$400.00
2168
115	Canada #C1-C9 (x 2), O253, O258, O273, OCE3. A nice little "Back of the Book" offering, consisting of two complete mint H/NH runs of the 1928 to 1946 issue airmails plus a mint quartet of 4-hole OHMS perfin Officials.

5520
119	Canada #E3. VF mint NH example of the 1927 issue 20c orange "Confederation" commemorative Special Delivery stamp. Very hard to find this well centered. 2021 Unitrade is $150.00 for VF mint NH. 2022 Scott US$70.00=	$87.50	$42.00
4038
120	Canada #E9. F/VF mint NH full sheet of 50 of the 1939 issue 10c surcharge on 20c dark carmine Special Delivery, plate #1. Some perf separations noted and the sheet has been folded in storage.

6081
122	Canada #F3. VF centred used example of the 1876 issue 8c dull blue Registration stamp. Lightened pen cancel. Unitrade is $450.00 for VF used. An elusive and welcome addition to any Canadian collection. 2021 Scott US$350.00=	$437.50	$120.00

128	Canada #FX119 var. Mint H/NH right margin block of 4 with UNLISTED misplaced and damaged overprint error, 14c red on 70c blue surcharged Three Leaf Excise Tax revenue. The overprint is much higher than it should be and shifted laterally as well, with the bottom row reading "14 Cen ... Cen" due to missing letters plus the denomination on the lower right stamp. Bottom pair is NH, with a couple of handling bends at right. Similar listed overprint varieties on this issue catalogue over $100 each without the NH premium. Estimate =	$160.00	$70.00

5917
136	Canada #O22. Complete matched set of plate #1 blocks of the 14c Hydroelectric Plant 1950-51 Official issue with 'G' overprint. Each block is lightly hinged in the selvedge only, leaving all stamps NH and thus catalogued as 16 VF NH singles. 2021 Unitrade =	$336.00	$50.00
5233
137	Canada #O33-O37. VF MNH/LH complete set of QEII Karsh issue plate blocks with 'G' Official overprint, in Post Office Fresh matched sets.

This overprint variety is not yet listed in Unitrade but the three Unitrade listed overprint shifts similar to this one (O20i, O40ii and O47iii) are valued at $75.00 to $187.50 EACH. This one is probably much scarcer. Estimate	$120.00	$70.00

141	Canada - 189 different very recent used 2018 - 2021 issues, including Covid issues up to Summer 2021 and includes the very scarce 'Flying Postal Truck' issued only to postal employees.

Estimate =	$150.00	$210.00
6108
142	Canada - Admiral blocks of 4 or larger accumulation of 61 used blocks. Mostly the 2¢ red & 2¢ green values, but some up to the $1 Admiral. So unusual and a great lot for the Admiral specialist! Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00

Released while the COVID pandemic was in full swing this issue was highly sought after and reportedly sold out within a couple of weeks. The press sheets, in particular, were soon being resold online for hundreds of dollars. There are 2 sheet types identified so far, with either an "8:51 AM" time stamp at the bottom of the sheet or a "3:53 PM" time stamp with a squiggly line flaw on the Monkey stamp; the AM sheet (offered here) appears to be much scarcer.

159	Canada - Souvenir book "Some Canadian Postage Stamps". Dark green hard cover book with embossed gilt "Some Canadian Postage Stamps" text and coat of arms on cover containing MNH blocks of various 1961-1964 period issues. Note that this book is the 1965 revised edition, printed by Roger Duhamel, F.R.S.C., Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery. I don't know why this scarce tome isn't listed in Unitrade. Darnell lists this book as #SP20 at $50.00 (an unreasonably low price considering how seldom you see these books) and it's at least as scarce as the Canada Post 1974 yearbook (which catalogues for $250.00 in Unitrade). VF condition. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
6216

The bottom card is posted from Newgate on July 6th, 1914 from the same sender as the first to Victoria. The sender also notes on the back 'N.B. Post Office name changed from Gateway to Newgate".

4178
168	Canada Covers - BC British Columbia postal history.

There are 500 items here including few earlier items noted, but primarily from the 1960’s to 1980’s period. This selection of cancels is far above average as each item was selected for quality of postmark. Some duplication to be found throughout, but a very diverse group of cancellation types including split ring, CDS. POCON and RC (retail centres). These covers would easily retail $3 to $5 each at a local show. We noted some cancels on piece and cover "front" in here too, these were not counted in the above total.

The second cover, although a bit rough around the edges is quite uncommon, sent from Baily (Ireland) 1882 to Kingston, Ontario. The cover was then remailed / reposted with the addition of three 1c Small Queens and sent to the St Louis Hotel in Quebec. This second cover is ex. Brigham with his ownership mark on the reverse. An attractive pair. Estimate =	$150.00	$32.00
3850
172	Canada Covers - Pioneer Airmail. The 1928 Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan special airmail flight to Winnipeg.

The cover is franked by CLP-7, of which there were only 200 stamps produced. There were only 161 covers flown. AAMC (American Air Mail Catalogue) Flight #PF-32. A showpiece / exhibit item. 2021 Unitrade =	$3,500.00	$1,650.00
3651
173	Canada Covers - Postal History Atrocity. A scandalous somewhat messy old-time mix of stamps both loose and on piece, torn from covers, parcels and shipping tags, mostly from the Admiral issue to the 1960's plus some earlier. Comes from a lifetime of saving bits of correspondence from the Criddle family of Manitoba and has tons of cancel interest. Mostly Canada with many foreign countries included for flavour. Note the old cigar box filled with primarily off-paper Admirals. Largely unchecked and offered as received, with a pre-packed weight of over 5 pounds. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
3969
174	Canada Covers - QEII Centennial Postal History. A select group of four covers featuring QEII "centennial" issue stamps, each extensively researched and written up on collector created pages. There are two censor covers, one from Montreal to Egypt in 1970, the other from Quebec to Pakistan in 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War. Next is a short-paid cover sent from Peterborough, Ontario to South Africa in 1969 with a South African postage due stamp applied. Lastly, a correct use of the $1 issue in combination with the 25c stamp paying the triple-weight registered rate to Nepal. Ex. Andrew Liptak Collection. A great group of covers for any postal historian. Estimate=	$150.00	$120.00
3850
175	Canada Covers - Toronto 1894 / 1895 pair of covers each franked with 10x 1/2c Small Queen stamps (#34) and sent to Skive, Denmark. An attractive pair, well above average for covers from this well-known correspondence. The 1894 cover bears five strikes of the Toronto squared circle, while the 1895 cover shows a very nice usage of the Toronto ORB cancel. Both with appropriate and readable receiving cancels. Worthy of any collection. Estimate=	$150.00	$55.00
4178
176	Canada Covers & Postcards - Valcartier Camp, Quebec WWI Postcard Exhibit. An astounding collection (actually a 1 frame exhibit - 16 pages) featuring 31 postcards showing the Militia Camp at Valcartier, Quebec during World War One. A variety of used & unused cards, each selected for both quality and condition by a very discerning collector. Valcartier Camp was constructed on the sandy plains, northwest of Quebec City. During the war, Valcartier Camp was the primary training base for the First Canadian Contingent before it departed for overseas service. An astounding glimpse back 100 plus years into military camp life. These cards reflect not only a pivotal time in Canada’s war history, but also reflect the beginning of a crucial time for many Canadians whose lives were to be forever changed by war.

222	Denmark #1. What at first appears to be a sound and F/VF used example of the 1851 issue 2rs blue with a choice "1" numeral postmark (Kjobenhavn) is actually a dangerous FORGERY (thanks for the heads-up Jay). Would have been a great "number one" for your Classic collection (2021 Scott US$1,000.00). Now it's just a conversation piece/spacefiller/reference item. Estimate -	$50.00	$32.00
3408
223	Denmark #3/56. Sixty-five used stamps from the 1854-1904 period. Includes many of the catalogued varieties with very few faults. Many very nice stamps noted in the mix.

The owner’s 2019 catalogue value on the booklets comes out at US$270.00. A nice clean lot from these ever-popular countries. Owner’s total combined 2019 Scott $670.00 =	$837.50	$120.00
6087

The pages themselves cover the periods of 1849 to 1954 (548 stamps) and 1991 to 2000 (318 stamps). The pre-1940 material is sparse with better coverage of commemoratives compared to definitives. The period from 1940 to 1954 has a better percentage of completion. The 1991-2000 section has good coverage to 1994, sparse for 1995-1996 and then good for 1997. The pages for 1998-2000 are empty. The earlier section of this lot catalogues US$2,836.65 and the more modern section catalogues US$499.80. Owner's total 2020 Scott US$ 3,336.45=	$4,170.56	$350.00

Binder full of MNH sheets from the 1921-23 post-war inflation era of Germany, consisting of 80 full or separated sheets of 100 plus other large blocks and part sheets.

Looks untouched since bought at auction in the 1980's where it had an estimate of $250-$350. 2022 Scott US$2066 =	$2,582.50	$100.00
5977

The total face value is 234 DM and, while the Deutsche Mark was formally demonetized in 2002 and fixed at 1.9558 DM to the Euro, it is known that some shipments from Germany still arrive with DM stamps - giving this lot a possible theoretical face value of €119.60. Inventory list enclosed. 2021 Scott catalogue value $610.00 =	$762.50	$110.00

5977
238	Great Britain #1. Eye-catching F/VF appearing used horizontal strip of four of the world-famous 1840 issue "Penny Black", plate positions "HI" to "HL". A RECENT REVIEW OF THIS LOT DETECTED A PRESSED OUT HORIZONTAL CREASE. This only the second four stamp multiple of this iconic stamp that we've ever offered. Scott Classic lists a used strip of three at US$1,875.00 ($2,343.75 CDN). An extra stamp added to the strip would technically push the value to over $3,000.00.

5567
85	Canada #198i. F/VF MNH upper sheet margin block of four of the scarcer brownish ochre shade of the 1932 issue 4c KGV Medallion. Catalogued by Scott as the regular ochre shade. 2022 Scott US$380.00=	$456.00	$160.00

6081
88	Canada #249-262. VF MH/MNH set of the 1942-43 KGVI War Issue in Post Office Fresh blocks of 4, with most low values hinged on 1 stamp only and most high values hinged on 2 stamps only, #259 with all stamps NH. A very scarce set in pristine full OG blocks. 2021 Unitrade	$1,025.00	$210.00
3811
89	Canada #334. VF MNH matched sets of plate #1 and plate #2 inscription blocks of the 1953 issue 50c green "Textile Industry". Nice to have a complete set of blocks. 2021 Unitrade	$264.00	$55.00
3501
90	Canada #356. Brilliant blocks from famed dealer K. Bileski, who examined 100,000 plate blocks of the 1955 Boy Scout World Jamboree and found only 4 that had any significant varieties. These MNH lower right blocks show the central brown Scout logo shifted either up or down, along with a dramatic misperf error. A most rare error from a period of tight printing control with very few errors escaping detection. Decades-old original retail price $500 with a copy of Bileski's write-up. Estimate	$250.00	$170.00
6012
91	Canada #460ii. Dealer lot of 3 MNH left margin blocks of the 6c black QEII Centennial issue on scarce hibrite paper. 2021 Unitrade	$240.00	$65.00
5526
92	Canada #468. 5¢ Centennial coil rarity, a mint NH "repair paste-up" strip of four. This item not given a Unitrade subtitle number, but is listed after #468xxi: "as 468 or 468xx repair paste-up pair" @ 150.00. Note this is a strip of four. 2021 Unitrade	$150.00	$120.00
4841
93	Canada #476, 476i, 477i. Lot of 3 VF MNH field stock panes of 100 of the 1967 Christmas issue, consisting of the 3c value on dull and Fluorescent papers and the 5c on Fluorescent paper. A fresh group. 2021 Unitrade	$325.00	$44.00
3613
94	Canada #522i, 525i (with and without 525ii). Archivally fresh Baker's Dozen (13) wholesale group of the scarce identical 5c and 6c centre blocks from the 1970 "Childrens' Drawings" Christmas issue. All of the 5c blocks have the "dot between M and A" plate variety, but the 6c blocks are more interesting, as they are a mix of the full "scratch through window" type, as well as ones without the "scratch" and others with only a very short "scratch". These probably come from an original K. Bileski hoard and probably have only been handled by the late, great Kasimir, the former King of Canadian Stamp Promotion. All valued as the basic centre blocks. A great lot for the dealer/collector of modern Canada. 2021 Unitrade	$1,040.00	$260.00
6035
95	Canada #556. ESSAY/PROOF VF quality Canadian Bank Note Company progressive proof of the 1971 issue 10c Christmas stamp in a left-hand sheet margin block of four. Perforated and with full Never Hinged gum. The proof consists of the lithographed background only (missing the engraved silver text and snowflake). The original retail value of this proof when it was first discovered was over $300.00 per stamp ($1,200.00 for a block). Estimate	$400.00	$210.00
3634
96	Canada #592. ONE BAR TAG ERROR. VF mint NH full field stock sheet of 100 of the the 7c brown Louis St. Laurent "Caricature" definitive, all one bar tagged. Owner identified by Ken Rose Adminware online catalogue as #592 G2aR @ $40.00 each. These will make a nice page in modern error collection. Owner's Rose catalogue	$4,000.00	$110.00
4465
97	Canada #599, 599a, 656, 657. VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks (both plate #2) of the 1973-1977 issue Vancouver Harbour (perf 12.5 x 12 and perf 13.3 x 13.3) and full panes of 8 of the 1974 Olympic issue $1.00 Diver and $2.00 Sprinter. Two panes of reach, different positions. 2021 Unitrade	$320.00	$90.00
5822
98	Canada #604T11. Fresh VF MNH G2aC 1-bar tagging error on 8c Royal Blue QEII Caricature issue coil block of 8. On MF paper with minor separation at left between rows along score line. Valued as 8 singles but worth more as an unsevered block. Adminware database retail value	$240.00	$48.00
6012
99	Canada #977. VF mint NH matched set of inscription blocks of four of the 1983 issue $2.00 Commonwealth Day high value commemorative. This was the first $1.00+ face value commemorative since the 1897 Jubilees! 2017 Unitrade	$250.00	$34.00
6012
100	Canada #1122. Tag error Unlisted and apparently unreported G4aB 3-bar tagging error on the top half of a full inscription pane of 50, 34c CAPEX '87 issue. The tagging is shifted down 2mm resulting in the top edge of fluorescent taggant in the perf holes below the design; on the top 5 rows this edge is below the centre of the perforations (so would not be on the perf tips) and on the bottom 5 rows it is above the centre of the perforations (so technically not a 3-bar error as the perf tips will have taggant). The pane has been folded along the centre horizontal perfs. Robin Harris' Adminware database lists a similar G4aT error, with the tagging shifted up rather than down, at $25 for a mint single and $175 for a plate block giving an overall retail value of $792.55. Estimate	$150.00	$110.00
5329
101	Canada #1194B, 1395 FORGERIES. VF mint strips of four of two different forgeries of "Flag" coil issues, both created with the intention of defrauding the Post Office. Both parties (one in Toronto, one in Montreal were eventually caught, with only a small number of the fakes ever ending up on cover. Estimate	$150.00	$40.00
3773
102	Canada #1574/2522. plus Extras All VF mint NH minted collection of 1995 to 2012 period issues. Includes singles, pairs, blocks and full miniature panes/sheetlets. Saw the complete NHL Hockey series, the Millennium issues, Lunar New Year commemoratives, definitive series, etc… Nice clean "plus value" material. Conservatively vaalued as useable face value postage only. Total Face Value	$699.75	$575.00
6052
103	Canada #1693ii, 1991C-1991D, 2642, 2642ii. VF mint NH trio of modern Unitrade listed varieties or elusive limited edition Canada Post issues. The group consists of 1) VF MNH example of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. 2) Complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheet. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in the sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarly find these sheets in collections we hle. 3) VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. Regular perforated sheet included. Total 2021 Unitrade $380.00	$380.00	$240.00
6108
104	Canada #1764b. VF MNH upper sheet margin example (proving beyond a doubt that it is the "sheet form" variety and not a re-perforated booklet stamp) of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2021 Unitrade	$500.00	$130.00
5038
105	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$450.00	$260.00
6128
106	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Exceptional investment opportunity consisting of seven complete VF MNH complete sets (all still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. The face value when issued was $8.73 but has since risen to $11.39 per pack, and although Unitrade now has this pictured among the other Quarterly Packs it is not yet priced as a complete pack (the catalogue value is for individual sheets only). A real sleeper set, sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2021 Unitrade	$455.00	$150.00
6035
107	Canada #2357iii. Extremely scarce Unitrade listed mint uncut press panel of 100 of the 2010 issue self-adhesive Striped Coralroot "P" (permanent) die cut coil. These uncut panes were issued in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very elusive modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the sheet is $92.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2020 Unitrade is not consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. The sheet has a light horizontal fold between the middle rows noted for the record. 2021 Unitrade	$180.00	$120.00
6128
108	Canada #3064i. "Missing red P", a used example tied to a small piece, along with a normal for comparison. Unitrade 2021 notes two used copies reported. No evidence of any tampering to remove the P. 2021 Unitrade	$1,250.00	$375.00
6012
109	Canada #B1-B12. VF mint NH complete run of all the 1974 to 1976 issue Montreal Olympics semi-postals, all in matched sets of plate blocks. Unchecked for possible better paper types. All valued as the common Unitrade listed types. 2021 Unitrade	$163.00	$38.00
5427
110	Canada #BCL63. British Columbia Law Stamp. VF MNH example of the very rare rouletted $1.00 blue with pale red underprint from the 1981 thirteenth series "Standing Justice" provincial law stamp. 2017 Van Dam	$312.50	$48.00
4261
111	Canada #BK66c, BK66d,. VF complete 1971 Centennial booklets with clear sealing strips, both showing a previously UNREPORTED 'Partial numbers on tab' variety and confirmed by Robin Harris. It is not often that you find new discoveries on such a popular and well-studied issue! Pen number '37' noted on the cover of 66c. Estimate	$100.00	$80.00
3606
112	Canada #C1/E11. Back of the Book Selection All mint 1898 to 1946 period group of 23 different Back of the Book issues. The stamps are mint NH to OG HR and consist of: a complete run of Airmails, three of the four Special Delivery Airmails and nine of the eleven Special Delivery issues. All neatly laid out on Hagner brand one stock sheet and all conservatively valued as Hinged (even though some NH noted). 2022 Scott US$663.60=	$796.32	$55.00
6035
113	Canada #C2, C4, E3, E4, J2a, J4a, J6-7, J9-27. Mint hinged (C2, C4, J2a, J4a, J13, J14) and fresh NH (all of the rest) Back of the Book lot of Airmail, Special Delivery and Postage Due issues.

5912
114	Canada #CE1-CE4, CO1-CO2, E1-E11, F1-F2, J1-J16B, O1-O45. All used selection of 84 different "Back of the Book" issues, all still mounted on the original White Ace album pages. Includes the key early overprinted Officals. 2022Scott US$611.20=	$733.44	$170.00
5115
115	Canada #CL3/CL52. All F/VF mint, mixed H and NH selection of 11 different Semi-Official airmail issues, plus an additional mint NH block of four of #CL44. These very collectable stamps date from the 1920s to early 1930s and are an evocative souvenir of the golden age of bush pilot "seat of the pants" aviation, usually in remote regions of our vast country. Listed in both Unitrade and Scott Classic catalogues, they continue to increase in popularity with every passing year (the centenary of the issue of some of these stamps is right around the corner). All neatly mounted on the original exhibit pages. 2021 Unitrade	$608.25	$220.00
6035
116	Canada #F3. Fine mint full OG HR example of the 1876 issue 8c dull blue Registration stamp. An attractive, sound and elusive welcome addition to any Canadian collection. 2022 Scott US$675.00=	$810.00	$120.00

5038

1786

6081

A similar lot to #88 in our last sale realized 190.00, but this has more recent Covid issues, including the scarce 'Flying Postal Truck', available only to postal workers and not sold to the public. Latest issues used are tough to find now with so few people using postal mail. Estimate	$150.00	$190.00
4057

5038
68	Canada #1194Bf. FORGERY Counterfeit imperforate mint NH strip of 10 of the 1990 issue 39c dark violet Flag coil. This fake was produced in Montreal with the intention of defrauding the post office but the ring was broken up by the RCMP before production was complete.

6108
71	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower left inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety multiple. 2021 Unitrade	$950.00	$375.00
6108
72	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c values for the 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. The lot includes the issued 50c and 88c stamps. 2021 Unitrade	$800.00	$260.00
269
73	Canada #1764b. VF MNH upper sheet margin block of four (proving beyond a doubt that it is the "sheet form" variety and not a re-perforated booklet pane) of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. A showpiece modern variety multiple. 2021 Unitrade	$2,000.00	$375.00

6032
75	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH. The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the Post Office quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2021 Unitrade	$161.00	$95.00
2626
76	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$500.00	$220.00
6108
77	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051A (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
5492
78	Canada #BK106-BK109. Two complete sets of four VF condition intact mint NH 1989 issue Christmas booklets consisting of the 33c ($3.30), 38c ($3.80), 44c ($2.20) and 76c ($3.80) value booklets.

See the consignor's descriptive inventory list for more info. Estimate	$200.00	$85.00
5592
58	Canada #726a/ii. VARIETY. VF MNH lower margin block of 10 of the $1.00 Fundy high value definitive, untagged from plate #2, with an ALBINO DOUBLE PRINTING ERROR of what should be the black inscriptions, especially strong on the lower 2 rows. The black that did get applied to the stamps is shifted down so that it is outside of the "beach" area where it normally is, and above is a clear un-inked "ghost" impression where the printing should have appeared on the first pass through the presses. Famed Canadian dealer K. Bileski marketed an error similar to this decades ago stating that there were only 2 sheets known; in our research we have not been able to locate this error reported on untagged stamps from plate #2. Estimate	$200.00	$130.00
6012
59	Canada #790iv. MISPERF. Spectacular mis-perforation error on the 17c green Parliament definitive on DF paper, showing decently proportioned parts of 4 different stamps. The previous owner notes that they paid $200.00 for this stamp. Estimate	$150.00	$150.00

Loaded with clean premium material, with "P" stamps and face values to $2.00 noted. Saw Lunar New Year sheets, loads of commemoratives and face values mostly in the 40c to 50c+ range. Conservatively valued at face value only. Total face value	$1,524.72	$1,525.00
6128
61	Canada #952a. Very pretty VF MNH vertical imperf pair of the 34c dull red brown 1985 issue Parliament coil issue. 2021 Unitrade.	$200.00	$150.00

Very useful collection of modern used Canada in 4 near-new 16-page stockbooks, as well as in a double mint sheet file filled with earlier multiples and more recent CTO cancelled MNH stamps, souvenir sheets, booklets and full panes, many with clear Telkwa, BC cancels. Noted a full stockbook page of used $10.00 Blue Whales including an intact pane of 2. Elusive modern material to be sure! Estimate	$120.00	$170.00
5841
64	Canada #1174i. VF mint NH upper left inscription block of the Autumn of 1989 printing of the 59c Musk Ox, Slater paper, perf 14.4 x 13.8. Unitrade notes that imprint blocks of this perf and paper variety are very scarce. 2021 Unitrade.	$250.00	$100.00

4249
67	Canada #1250ii. Upper left position VF mint NH inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative. Most inscription blocks were withdrawn due to problematic and incredibly poor printing quality. Only one inscription block was allowed per customer and only through mail order from the National Philatelic Centre. 2021 Unitrade.	$250.00	$130.00
4249
68	Canada #1507-1508. UNTAGGED ERRORS. "Left-hand" and "right-hand" examples of the 1994 issue 43c self-adhesive "Greetings" booklet stamps, still on a portion of the original booklet.

6012
69	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower right inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety multiple. 2021 Unitrade.	$950.00	$240.00
6108
70	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c values from the 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes on NF Coated Papers, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. Also includes examples of the issued denominations on LF Peterborough Paper. 2021 Unitrade.	$803.00	$300.00
6108
71	Canada #1601b (BK190 IMPERFORATE). VF mint condition, pristine and intact 1996 issue "Special Occasions" Greetings Booklet #3, containing a self-adhesive pane of ten 45c stamps, WITH THE DIE-CUTTING COMPLETELY OMITTED. Only four panes have recorded and one of these panes has been separated into 3 sections. Needless to say, as one of the 3 remaining panes this is a modern booklet error of the utmost magnitude. The booklet comes with a 2010 APES photo certificate which states, in part "genuine in all respects". Never seen one before! 2020 Unitrade.	$5,000.00	$1,175.00
6012
72	Canada #1630ai. VF MNH investment lot of 50 of the 1997 Year of the Ox souvenir sheet of two x 45c Lunar New Year stamps with the additional limited edition "Hong Kong 97" logo printed in lower right corner of the sheet. This is the scarcest (and first) Lunar New Year souvenir sheet. Excellent investment opportunity. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$55.00
5526
73	Canada #1700 (BK236). DRAMATIC MIS-CUT. VF and intact booklet pane of the 2000 issue 47c "Flag over Inukshuk" die-cut self-adhesive, with the horizontal die-cut severely misplaced towards the top of the pane, creating large "one and two thirds" stamps on the bottom row and "one third" stamps at top. A black and white copy of the booklet with red die-cut indicators helps to explain the error. Estimate	$250.00	$80.00
6012
74	Canada #1969, 1970 TRIPLE ARTIST SIGNED. VF mint NH complete pane of 25 of the 2003 issue 48c "Year of the Ram" plus the $1.25 souvenir sheet, both sheets triple signed by the illustrator/calligrapher (Rosina Li), sculptor/illustrator (Christopher Reid) and the illustrator (Jason Li). Very few of these panes/sheets were signed (it was a small side event at the stamp unveiling in Vancouver). Estimate	$150.00	$42.00
6087
75	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$500.00	$220.00
6012
76	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
6108

84	Canada #O1/O45. Mint stock/hoard of "O.H.M.S." and "G" overprinted official issues, running between #O1 to #O45 (no $1.00 values), all organized in marked glassine envelopes. Unchecked by us for overprint varieties as well as the gum status - there have been no 50% NH premiums added thus the catalogue value could be much higher as all stamps have been conservatively valued as Hinged (but saw some Hinged and no gum at a glance). 2021 Unitrade.	$565.30	$130.00
5841
85	Canada #O1/O45. Sorted and catalogued used hoard of "O.H.M.S." and "G" overprinted official issues between #O1 and #O45, all organized in marked glassine envelopes.

Includes a section for Provinces (just Newfoundland). Not all sets go to high value and there is some oxidation from softeners in the page protectors noted. Owner's older catalogue total is $2,016.00. Of note is a "Q" flaw on a #14. An additional 3-ring binder containing mostly used 1970s to 2000s period material is a disorganized addendum to the first album. Estimate	$200.00	$110.00
5977

Older prices quoted but in a quick check doesn't seem to be much different from newer prices. Mostly used. This lot came to the owner along with a huge lot of 20+ moving boxes/cartons, including the Commonwealth (that he wanted). The consignor doesn't collect nor have any interest in or knowledge of Portugal. Also unchecked by us.

The glassines (approx. 750) generally contain a few to several stamps, in some cases as many as 30 or so in each.

One will always find a few damaged in a lot as large as this, but appears to be in generally Fine condition. A few unidentified. Hours and hours of fun and treasure hunting here (qty: 5000+- stamps).

All counted as hinged - there is definitely an upside to this lot. Precancels are a bonus, not included in catalogue total.

This is the scarcer October 1996 printing by Ashton-Potter Canada Limited on Coated Papers, perforated 13.1 x 13.1.

6108
85	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$500.00	$220.00
3266
86	Canada #2201a. The 2007 issue 52c "Year of the Pig" missing gold error in VF MNH condition. This was that year's major error. We have seen these sell on eBay for up to $900.00 US each (back in the day). Normal stamp included for comparison. 2020 Unitrade.	$100.00	$70.00
4249
87	Canada #2847a (BK 623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00

Each booklet has a different numbered reverse (1 to 24) featuring a different "Did you know?" Olympic fact and photograph. An insanely difficult group to assemble with a total present day face value of $220.80. The Unitrade catalogue value of a complete set is ridiculously low considering how seldom we see sets of these booklets. 2021 Unitrade for 24 basic individual booklets.	$408.00	$425.00
5542

4652
127	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #4. VF appearing four margin, lightly cancelled used example of the 1851 issue 6p yellow green imperforate. Expertly rebacked and gummed (?), still a more than acceptable looking pre-Confederation rarity. 2022 Scott US$825.00=	$990.00	$260.00

151	Greece - Collection/Accumulation. Relatively well organized "better than good" start to a decent mint and used Greek collection, consisting of thousands of stamps (and a few covers) in albums, on stock pages, stock cards and loose.

Better areas include early airmail sets, some imperf Hermes Heads, used early 19th century sets (unchecked) and then, a decent representation of medium value issues throughout. This unpicked Greek lot, unlike the Trojan Horse, might actually bear some gifts! Estimate	$500.00	$400.00

Note CHAMBA #O61 mint NH (Scott US$105.00) and KISHANGARH #57, 57a used (Scott US$282.50 if legitimate), so chance for more goodies as this lot is just as received from an estate.

VF condition Scott Specialty album with pages from 1852 to 1965, containing a smattering of mostly used stamps from India proper with a catalogue value of US$289.40 (=$347.28 CDN @1.20) The real value of this lot is the album and the pages for the Indian "Back of the Book" material and all the various Convention and Feudatory States.

Sixth volume of this Classic holding including a varied range of countries e.g. Mongolia, Orange Free State, Central and South America, Siam, Northern Mongolia, Tibet, Venezuela and more. See the scan of the inventory list for full description. As usual, no continental Europe. Of special note are Persia (over 500 stamps) and the USA. Both are quite comprehensive with substantial catalogue values. The Persia sets of 1902 and 1903 overprints have not been included in the value as their authenticity has not been acknowledged. Had they been included the value would have been increased by several thousands of dollars. The USA collection includes a goodly number of higher values, most particularly in the Large Banknotes.

Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

Indeed, filling it could be a lifetimes' enjoyment, as were the precious four albums, and the final sixth one to come subsequently. Consignors 2019 Scott US$4,555.10=	$5,466.12	$600.00

200	Worldwide Supplies - Ultra Violet Lamp Duo. Two different UV lamps, each useful in its own right. The first lamp is a Raytech model BS-1 UV Lamp. An oldie but goodie ultraviolet workhorse, the Raytech model BS-1 (broad spectrum) is an excellent "all round" AC powered lamp, for both stamps and mineral samples. The old retail was well in the $100.00 plus range. Solid metal case, glass filter, 0.35 amps lamp. The second lamp is a "no-name" metal housed AC powered UV lamp designed to detect counterfeit bills. We use a lamp like this because the housing blocks out extraneous light when comparing papers or tags, mainly on Canadian stamps. A useful pair for any collector. Estimate	$100.00	$65.00
3148

6087
4	British Commonwealth - Classic Forgeries. Relatively crude and amusing selection of 19 different thoughtfully prepared but "won't fool anyone" GB overprinted Officials and Niger Coast/Oil Rivers overprints on Queen Victoria and Edward VII period issues. The Official overprints (including doubles and inverts!) appear to be rubber stamped and the Niger Coast/Oil Rivers overprinted stamps all have UK cancels (a pretty dead giveaway). As genuine these would catalogue in the tens of thousands! A great reference group, as these are from a very old collection and may be listed in some specialized literature published over the past century. Estimate	$150.00	$24.00
2271

Lovely #8 sized 1935 commercial cover to Jamaica, franked with a VF vertical pair of the 2c GeoV Silver Jubilee, the bottom stamp showing a very clear and strong example of the "Dot by Flagstaff" constant plate flaw (Stanley Gibbons #301h, Plate 4, R8/4). The SG pricing factor is from 6 x for this issue on cover. SG catalogue value for the used stamp alone is £130.00=$220.00 CDN. As nice an example of this popular variety on cover as you will see. Estimate	$300.00	$190.00
4506
8	Canada #1. Lightly cancelled used 1851 issue 3p Beaver imperf on horizontally laid paper. Faulty but still a good "starter" example of this classic Canadian First Issue. 2021 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,300.00	$160.00

6016
12	Canada #14/489 plus Back of the Book. Mixed condition, all used 1859 to 1969 period collection of 549 stamps, all hinged on Minkus album pages. The bulk of the value is in the 19th Century material. Lots of stuff here but expect faults and make sure your bid takes the overall condition into account to avoid disappointment. See the scan of the corrected inventory sheet for more details. 2021 Scott US$3,051.35=	$3,965.45	$260.00
3732
13	Canada #15/846 plus Back of the Book and Provinces. All used 1859 to 1979 period collection of 719 stamps and one booklet pane, all mounted on Jarrett album pages or on 3-ring quadrille pages.

A marvelous reference group for the Large Queen collector wanting to authenticate varieties by date of usage or the classic Canadian "calendar" collector. Needless to say, a tough group to assemble. All described in detail for papers and perfs. 2021 Scott US$2,000.00=	$2,600.00	$230.00
4197
17	Canada #23iii. Fresh and Fine CDS dated used example of the Unitrade listed 1c yellow orange Large Queen on thin paper (Duckworth paper 9B). A very elusive paper type.

5868
20	Canada #35, 37, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46. Mint selection of seven different Small Queens, in very mixed condition. The 1c, 3c and 5c are sound mint OG H/HR; the 6c is sound mint no gum; the 8c, 10c and 20c values are all with faults (scuffs, thins). A good Small Queen "starter"group.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

3266
74	Canada #E4. VF Mint NH JUMBO margin example of the 1930 issue 20c henna brown "TWENTY CENTS" Special Delivery stamp.

Great colour, perfect gum, crazy margins. 2020 Scott US$125.00=	$162.50	$50.00

64	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$85.00
6091

Very few people actually used these stamp dispensing machines as they were notoriously bug-laden in the early days and no first day covers of these overlooked issues were produced. I've never seen a properly franked assemblage of these issues on cover before and doubt I'll see anything like these in the future. Here's your chance. Sure to become gems of modern postal history! Unpriced in Unitrade on cover. Estimate	$325.00	$375.00

The lot also includes a carefully and properly prepared set of five December 16th 2016 postmarked "in period" #8 size covers, all franked with the late 2016 issue "Landscapes by Canadian Painters" computer vended postage stamps. Each of the five covers is a different $1.20 USA rate value mailed from Vancouver BC to the US (posted from the one post office that issued these stamps). Very few people actually purchased these stamps or used these stamp dispensing machines as they were notoriously bug-laden in the early days and no first day covers of these overlooked issues were produced. Sure to become modern philatelic rarities. The mint stamps are hard to find in any quantity, wholesaling for well above the face value (original face value total of the mint is $174.00) and are also as of yet unpriced in Unitrade on cover.

71	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet.

Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time.

72	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

9	Canada #4ix. Relief Break Plate Flaw. VF used example of the 3p Beaver imperf, showing a clear example of the constant "relief break" plate flaw.

82	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

72	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

While there is duplication to be expected, the range of issues is impressive. The total face value of this lot is $1,745.73 and Canada Post now charges $1.00 over face value per cover, so the original cost of this group would easily be over $2,500.00!

132	Gibraltar #4/130. Mint and used (sometimes both) selection of 1886-1950 period issues, generally in Fine, sound condition. Fifty-three stamps in total, including some colour and perf varieties. The mint #110 is perf 13½ and the used #111 and 114 are also both 13½. The 1 shilling Edward in brownish bistre is an anomaly although very obviously a genuine used stamp with proper watermark and apparently genuine postal cancel. Likely and early printing error and more research will be required. It's easy to speculate but some documentation would help. The consignor thinks that it is a real find. Valued as a regular used 1shilling. A further philatelic note is that the A11 type 10c rose was mailed from Tangier, no doubt close to the time that these stamps were overprinted for such use, in 1898.
