81	Canada #926A. Pristine selection of five VF mint NH matched sets of blank corner blocks (these don't come with inscriptions) of the short lived 1987 issue 36c plum QEII definitive. The October 1 issue definitive was delayed repeatedly (from May 6, 1987) due to production difficulties and not released until near the end of the 36c rate period. Thus, this value was current for just three months, during which time the 1987 Christmas stamps would have seen most of the usage. A clean and increasingly scarce investment group. All still in the original Canada Post sealed packaging. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$80.00

87	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH sheet margin block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date.

The first 5 full VF MNH uncut Lunar New Year press sheets in the original tubes, 1997-2001 issues, starting with the very scarce Year of the Ox, #1630aiv.

5528
90	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was NOT included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). This unsevered booklet of thirty (#1991b) is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph of the Post Office building runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $72.00. A "sleeper" booklet type and scarce Olympic topical. 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$85.00

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$200.00	$110.00
3725
100	Canada #CL42. REPRINTS. Unitrade listed unofficial reprints in four different colours of the 1927 issue 25c Yukon Airways semi-official airmail issue in full VF mint NH sheets of 10. A spectacular addition to any semi-official airmail collection. 2017 Unitrade.	$250.00	$46.00

4818
110	Canada - Mint and Used Stock/Accumulation. Almost all Canada duplicated stock of several thousand singles, blocks, panes and strips, with the value mostly in the mint GeoV to early QEII period material. Didn't see any 50c or $1.00 values but saw a decent quantity of quality low to middle values. Unchecked for plate numbers or varieties. Some faulty material and no gum items noted for accuracy. All semi-sorted in three old manila page stockbooks. An empty GeoVI era springback included in the mix. The total catalogue value should add up to a couple of thousand dollars.

Three different VF quality complete sets of six of the "NHL All-Stars" stamp cards, consisting of the 2000 set (#93), the 2001 set (#100) and the 2002 set (#110). We rarely ever see these officially produced Canada Post card/stamp crossover sets and they pre-date the change of Post Office policy which precluded living persons being depicted on stamps. Note that Wayne Gretzky is card #1 from series #1. Unitrade is totally out to lunch with these for pricing but it's the only reference we have. 2017 Unitrade.	$85.00	$90.00

3613
120	Canada Covers/Cancels - Alberta Selection. Quartet of covers/cards, all with rare Alberta postmarks. Consists of a 1904 Rosenroll transit/receiver, a smudged 1919 Seymour receiver on postcard from Oregon, a Livingston as one of several faint postmarks on a 1906 postcard and an UNREPORTED Seba split ring faintly struck on a 1909 card.

The Chung/Narbonne catalogue will value this lot higher. 2016 Unitrade.	$566.50	$50.00

5233
83	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two VF quality complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed.

This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Both the souvenir sheet and booklets were withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reaching private hands. The recalled souvenir sheet is proving to be much scarcer than the booklet but all Hoodoo items are getting harder to find with each succeeding month. Estimate	$250.00	$170.00

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Getting harder to find with each succeeding month.

These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps.

Neatly organized in numbered stockbooks, in numbered glassine envelopes and hinged on foolscap pages (as well as some loose in a shoebox). Saw material as early as First Cents issues (a smattering), numerous Small Queens (½c to 50c, early and late printings), lots of higher value 20th Century items, decent Back of the Book, some Provinces and recent face values as high as $8.00.

The owner's valuation estimate is very conservative. Estimate	$500.00	$450.00
2236
117	Canada - QEII Diamond Jubilee Keepsake Folder. The complete collection of all six volumes of the 2012 issue Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Canada Post issue keepsakes as well as the Kate and William Royal Keepsake Kit, all neatly stored in a special multi-page folder.

A great lot for the modern error fan, with some "new find" flavour in the mix. Estimate	$250.00	$110.00
4560
120	Canada Cancels - BC cancel Goldmine consisting of 67 "D" rated cancels and 14 "E" rated cancels, on stamp, on piece and on stamp on piece. All neatly organized and identified on four stocksheets.

3266
121	Canada Perfins #MR1-MR4. War Tax revenue specialty collection. Unique in that there is no perfin pattern duplication within any group presenting a respectable count of 48 all-different patterns. A substantial quantity of random material would be required to reproduce this offering of 133 "D" to "I" rarity issues. Definitely an advanced base towards a "Perfins on Revenues" themed exhibit. Owner's estimate	$335.00	$180.00
3755
122	Canada Perfins - A valuable group of 11 private perfins, comprised of 5 QV "Numeral" issues and 6 of the KEVII series all bearing the S13 "Sun Life Assurance Company" pattern.

Valued by the owner as regular used stamps. 2017 Scott US$292.80=	$378.05	$55.00
3755
123	Canada Perfins - Meaty remainders of a lifetime commercial perfin collection. With over 1,200 definitive issues in the 'I' - 'D' rarity range and well over 100 different patterns, this lot will prove valuable to all levels of collectors and for those building same-issue/pattern in all 8-positions sets. It has been some time since we've offered a diverse large quantity with cleaner punches as this! Owner's estimate	$280.00	$85.00
3755
124	Canada Perfins - Splits and Doubles. Once considered 'seconds', splits and doubles are gaining interest considering their relative obscurity (from culling) and have become quite collectable in their own right. This lot contains 83 splits and 59 doubles illustrating varying degrees of mis-perforating. A very, very difficult group to duplicate! Owner's estimate	$375.00	$110.00
3755

Missing the vertical perforations at left creating a vertical strip of ten of #FB41a - "imperf at left". Noted the usual uneven gumming as often seen on this issue.

2891
133	Canada Revenues #FWT5. Sound and Fine used sheet margin block of four of the "Inland Revenue/War Tax" overprint in black on the 5c blue KGV Admiral. This block was clearly used for revenue usage and so is catalogued and valued as a revenue. Unitrade catalogue lists this stamp as #MR2Bi when used postally. 2009 Van Dam.	$300.00	$55.00
5106

4704
137	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #19 // 126. Stocksheet with mint 1861-1919 period issues. #82 and #115/126 counted as NH, the rest counted as hinged. Some are NH but with gum disturbance. See scanned inventory list. 2016 Scott Classic / 2017 Scott US$498.12=	$784.55	$140.00

982
139	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #20, 21. The 6p rose & 6½p rose Heraldic Emblem imperfs in sound USED condition. These are difficult stamps to find used and these are two excellent and collectible examples. Noted for the record, there may be a hint of a thin in each stamp but they could just as easily be natural paper flaws. 2017 Scott US$337.50=	$438.75	$75.00

5242

152	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #J7, J7i, J7ii. Full MNH sheet of 100 of the 1949 issue 10c dark violet watermarked postage due, perf 11. This sheet represents two complete settings of 50 for this plate and as such shows both the "LUE" and "dot after DUE" varieties twice. The "LUE" variety is listed in the Scott Classic catalogue but the "dot" variety is not; seeing as how they are both constant varieties this sheet has been valued as 4 variety stamps and 96 MNH stamps. Some natural horizontal wrinkles noted for the record, as most of these remaining sheets have wrinkling from storage. A spectacular showpiece sheet. 2016 Scott Classic US$2,124.00=	$2,761.20	$300.00

5456
10	Canada #14 // 101, F1-F2. Lot of used early Canada, starting with the 1859 "First Cents" and mostly QV issues, neatly laid out on a Hagner stock sheet.

5242
19	Canada #25. Fine appearing mint example of the 3c red Large Queen. The hinged gum is probably not original and the stamp has a faulty upper left corner. Otherwise a rare Canadian classic in mint condition. 2016 Scott US$2,250.00=	$2,812.50	$150.00

5445

Many better noted such as #192i mint LR plate block of 10 with the "broken E" variety and #199i major re-entry in a used block of 4 with 3 normal. Expect the odd fault, but a large offering of early used blocks is scarce. 2016 Scott US$1,381.00=CDN$1,795.30 plus 2016 Unitrade $369.50=	$2,164.80	$180.00

4841
81	Canada #2201a. The 2007 issue 52c "Year of the Pig" missing gold error in VF MNH condition. This was that year's major error. We have seen these sell on eBay for up to $900.00 US each (back in the day). 2016 Unitrade.	$100.00	$55.00

Conservatively valued as normal used sheets. 2016 Scott US$164.00=	$213.20	$65.00

These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in the sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed.

4901
95	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper right position plate block of four of the unissued 1994 Xmas 52c rate stamp.

5024

These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in the sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2016 Unitrade.	$100.00	$75.00
4901
99	Canada - Hoodoos Booklets. Investment lot of five of the 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. All are in VF mint condition.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet group has great future return potential, as they are not yet listed in Scott catalogue. As officially issued, then withdrawn, these booklets they are guaranteed to be given their own catalogue numbers as well as designated spaces in all the Canadian album supplements.
