105	China - PRC #628. VF used (CTO First Day Cancel) 1962 issue $3 "Mei Lan-fang" souvenir sheet. This souvenir sheet is very rare and is the key PRC souvenir sheet, with only 20,000 printed. This sheet comes from a presentation album given to an employee of the diplomatic corps serving in China in the early 1960s. While there is some paper interleaving adhered to the gum on the back, the sheet is fresh and fault free. A small white line at upper left is a natural printing anomaly noted for the record. Needless to say missing from the vast majority of PRC collections. We haven't had one of these for quite some time. A true modern PRC rarity of the highest order. 2013 Scott US$12,500.00=	$12,500.00	$7,150.00

While the identification and pricing has been done by the owner, he seems to be accurate and the catalogue valuation is probably a bit low due to recent increases in the calatogue value of material from this area. Owner's total 2010/2011 Scott US$576.55=	$576.55	$160.00

3556
22	Canada #45iv. VF used example of the 10c brown red Small Queen with the "gash in right 1 of 10" variety (position 85). One short perf at left noted for the record. An elusive and welcome addition to any Small Queen or plate variety collection. 2012 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00

4860
2	Australia #132. The 1932 issue 5/- Sydney Bridge used, a VF example! 2012 Scott US$350.00=	$350.00	$130.00

5	Australia - Four different constant varieties on 4d violet KGV "Head" issue used, including ACSC #111(1)g "Lower left frame worn", 111(1)i "Splintered SW corner", 111(1)j "White scratch crown to head", and 111(1)o "White flaw behind emu leg". 2007 Australian Commonwealth Specialist's Catalogue AUD$240.00=	$255.00	$95.00
3440

8	Austro-Hungarian WWI Military Postcards - Mini-hoard of 140 used WWI period Fieldpost and Red Cross POW cards. Mostly addressed to Bohemian, Moravian or Czech families and individuals. Excellent range of card types, censor markings and fieldpost cancels. A great source of research material for the military historian, as the various regimental markings, the prisoner of war camp chops and the censor handstamps (both Russian and Austro-Hungarian) are mostly clear strikes. An under-researched area of military postal history. Estimate	$210.00	$110.00
4582
9	British Commonwealth - 1946 Peace Issue Omnibus Collection. The most comprehensive and well laid out collection of the WWII Peace and Victory commemoratives, all housed in a fat Frank Godden "Burleigh" album.

Most issues are represented by mint and CDS used singles, mint or CDS used blocks of 4 (used blocks of this issue are very scarce) and the set on cover (FDC or regular philatelic frankings, some covers have blocks). While covers of this issue often have a very high premium, the entire lot has been catalogued as mint and used stamps only. Lots of upside for the Omnibus issue, Geo VI or WWII specialist. 2012 Scott US$611.90=	$611.90	$230.00
4203
10	British Commonwealth - A-Z collection. Mint and (mostly) used collection of over 5,500 Victorian to modern era stamps, all neatly and lightly hinged on quadrille album pages in a fat but tired Harris 2-post binder. Noted strength in Canada, Australia and States, GB, and New Zealand but saw lots of useful material including various Trucial States, lots of British Africa, Caribbean & Pacific, Iraq, Egypt etc. Sure to be a rewarding and worthwhile project for the Commonwealth aficionado. Estimate	$250.00	$170.00
3408
11	British Commonwealth - Massive mostly used collection / accumulation in two binders. Noted strength in Australia, (including States and Territories), New Zealand, British Africa, British Asia and some Caribbean. Over 4,700 stamps total. Saw better items in the mix.

All neatly stored in a special Stanley Gibbons "Royal Events" binder with a registered Certificate of Authenticity (Limited Edition Number 1895). The album pages themselves are well laid out and quite informative. Needless to say, these two collections had a huge original issue cost. Here's your chance to buy the group for a fair aftermarket price. 237 different stamps and 25 different souvenir sheets total. 2012 Scott US$379.25=	$379.25	$65.00
77
13	British Commonwealth - Stanley Gibbons "New Imperial Postage Stamp Album", Volume I. The first volume (Great Britain, Antigua to Malta) of this classic and popular 2-volume set for 1840-1936 colonial issues. Lightly used and in VF condition. There are 380 mostly used stamps lightly hinged into the album with strength in GB (saw Victoria and Edwards to the shilling as well as Geo V Seahorses, etc.) and Canada (saw Tercentenary issues to the 7c and a good range of GeoV issues). A good way to start to an "old school" Commonwealth collection. Estimate	$120.00	$75.00
3634
14	British Commonwealth - Used collection of 2,529 mostly different stamps, Victorian era to modern period issues. Most of the stamps are from Australia & States, Canada, GB and New Zealand. Estimate	$120.00	$90.00

4965
18	Canada #8. VF appearing but "enhanced" used four margin example of the 1857 issue half penny rose imperf. Expertly rebacked to enlarge the size of the margins. Still a great looking stamp. 2012 Scott US$700.00=	$700.00	$80.00
3534
19	Canada #14 // 511p plus Back of the Book. Mint and used collection of 648 stamps in a Darnell Album with pages to 1981. The material goes up to 1971 only.

Mostly used (the two 1/2c Small Queens are mint) selection of Large and Small Queens on one stocksheet.

4901
22	Canada #24b VARIETY, #25b VARIETY. Used examples of the 2c green and 3c red Large Queens, both on Duckworth paper type 1 but both showing a distinct horizontal weave. While Duckworth himself only noted vertical weave type 1 paper, it has been determined that horizontal weave type 1 exists for around 1% of the paper type 1 printing total. The 24b is sound, the 25b has a small tear. A rare duo. Estimate	$200.00	$190.00
3534
23	Canada #25. Fine mint (traces of OG) example of the 1868 issue 3c red Large Queen. 2012 Scott US$1,900.00=	$1,900.00	$230.00

The knowledgeable collector has noted that this stamp is printed on Shoemaker's paper F. Note also that the stamp has a thin spot. Catalogued as a regular #30c. A great reference item for the Large Queen collector. 2012 Scott US$1,350.00=	$1,350.00	$110.00

1514
31	Canada #34ii. VF+ mint VLH Jumbo and Fine MNH horizontal sheet margin pair of the half cent black Small Queen on thick white paper.

29	Canada #50. F-VF MNH upper left corner block of four of the half cent black 1897 Jubilee issue.

4247
33	Canada #62. VF centered mint example of the 1897 issue $2.00 dark purple high value Jubilee. The 2011 Vincent Greene certificate states "unused but regummed, broken creases in middle of stamp" The "creases" are actually normal wrinkles caused by paper shrinkage after gumming. A nicer stamp than the certificate suggests. Unitrade is $2,000.00 for VF mint hinged. 2012 Scott US$1,400.00=	$1,400.00	$350.00

1672
37	Canada #91iii, 91iv, 91vi re-entries. Sound and Fine used trio of the 5c blue on bluish Edward, each one with a Unitrade listed major re-entry, even though only #91iii is priced in Unitrade ($75.00 for Fine used). I don't see why the others, which are just as scarce aren't valued so the trio is valued as 3 x the Fine used single price of #91iii. 2012 Unitrade.	$225.00	$130.00
4558
38	Canada #97i, 98i. Mint pair of "hairlines" variety items from the 1908 Quebec Tercentenary set consisting of a VF Hinged 1c green single (97i) and a Fine H/NH block of 4 of the 2c carmine (98i). 2012 Unitrade.	$660.00	$70.00

4247
42	Canada #122b. Fresh and Fine centered CDS used block of 4 of the $1.00 orange Geo V Admiral (wet printing) with type D lathework in the selvedge at bottom. Some minor perf separation and small faults (light creases and small paper cut from the cancel) noted for the record. Nice early (December 1923) date.

4126
61	Canada #374-775 plus Back of the Book. VF MNH 1957-1977 period collection, all neatly stored in Hawid style mounts on Minkus album pages. Only missing the odd postage due to be complete for the period and includes better additional items like the Centennial precancels. Owner's 2012 Unitrade catalogue valuation seems accurate. Unitrade.	$456.25	$60.00
4997
62	Canada #462piv. Full VF MNH sheet of 50 of the 10c olive green "Jack Pine" Centennial, Winnipeg 2 bar tag, LF paper, PVA gum. 2012 Unitrade.	$375.00	$38.00

2626
65	Canada #1534ii. VF MNH sheet margin example of the unissued 52c value from the 1994 Xmas set. A few of these stamps, printed in anticipation of a possible rate increase, got out of Post Office hands and into the philatelic marketplace. Oops! 2012 Unitrade.	$200.00	$65.00
3613
66	Canada #1535ii. The rare unissued 1994 Xmas 90c proposed and rejected rate change, VF MNH. Much scarcer than the unissued 52c value from the same set, as fewer than 1,000 examples of this stamp exist. 2012 Unitrade.	$600.00	$210.00

A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. Total present face value over $90.00 (which will go up due to the "P" stamps in the sheets). 2012 Unitrade.	$300.00	$120.00
4663

Includes numerous complete sets including coils, imperfs, long pictorial sets to the $1.00 value and Back of the Book material.

4629
91	Canada - Millennium Collection. Deluxe hard cover coffee table book produced by the Post Office as a 2000 Millennium souvenir. Contains special printings of 68 different commemoratives in large format panes of four. This book was criticized for containing stamps that were not made available to the general public.

96	Canada Covers - Collection/accumulation of 220 lightly duplicated 1964-2010 period First Day Covers, either neatly stored in a Unitrade FDC album or loose.

2626
123	China #78. VARIETY. VF appearing mint example of the 1897 issue 1 cent surcharge on 3c red revenue.

Clean sometimes heavily duplicated hoard of over 21,000 mint NH or mint no gum as issued 1940s era stamps, all neatly stored in old #8 size window envelopes. Many stamps are in large multiples. This material is from an old time dealer's back-up stock that hasn't seen the light of day for decades. There aren't very many complete sets in this lot but what is here will certainly be useful to the collector or dealer of Chinese material as it hasn't been gone over for overprint or plate varieties. 2012 Scott total US$7,880.40=	$7,880.40	$3,525.00
2263
126	China #C44. Clean mini-hoard of 53 MNH 1946 issue $53.00 surcharges on 15c grey green "Junkers F-13" airmails.

The Scott value of $19.00 each is unclear as to whether this is for hinged or never hinged. 2012 Scott total US$1,007.00=	$1,007.00	$160.00
4054

No complete sets but noted better individual stamps with strong topical interest (flowers, sports, medicine, space, etc.).

2626
3	Asia - Mostly used conglomeration of over 1,200 mint and used stamps as received from consignor.

13	British Commonwealth Supplies - Used Stanley Gibbons "Commonwealth and British Empire" 1840-1970 catalogue, 2010 edition.

Not many changes between this edition and the most recent version. Estimate	$100.00	$40.00
77
14	British Honduras #14 // 98, MR2-MR5. Clean mint hinged group of 49 Victorian through KGV period stamps, all neatly displayed on a Hagner stocksheet. Some duplication is noted but there may be shades that other catalogues may list. 1884-1922 period issues. 2012 Scott US$377.70=	$377.70	$70.00

16	Canada #1P. Sheet margin example of the 1857 issue proof in red of the 3 penny beaver imperf, Canada's first stamp. Often mistaken for a real stamp as there is no specimen overprint. 2012 Unitrade.	$300.00	$85.00
4743
17	Canada #4 // 88. Very mixed condition selection of 67 different 1852 to 1899 period stamps. All faulty, several placed in the wrong spots on the pages. Still a great starter group for the collector wanting to begin 19th century material. 2012 Scott US$4,540.15=	$4,540.15	$325.00
4278

4489

4837

21	Canada #14 (x 13), 17, 18 (x 6), 19. Mixed quality used accumulation of 21 used 1859 First Cents issues. Noted good range of shades, papers and perfs. Faults to be expected but certainly lots of upside for the specialist. Catalogued by basic Scott only US$2,230.00=	$2,230.00	$170.00
4784
22	Canada #14 // 20, 22 // 29. Mixed condition used selection of twenty 1859-1876 period "First Cents" and "Large Queen" issues. Most with faults but unchecked for perfs, papers, shades and plate varieties. A good study lot for the classic student. 2012 Scott US$2,775.00=	$2,775.00	$140.00
4784
23	Canada #15 // 558 plus Back of the Book. Mint and used collection of over 600 different mint and used stamps, 1859-1971 period issues.

4827
25	Canada #22. F/VF mint example of the 1868 issue 1c brown red Large Queen. Seems to be OG NH but is actually expertly regummed to appear never hinged. (The premium for NH Large Queens is 300%). 2012 Scott US$750.00=	$750.00	$160.00
4965
26	Canada #22a. VF appearing but repaired used example of the 1c brown red Large Queen watermarked paper showing the "TH" portion of the watermark. The repair consists of an expertly replaced upper right corner (well clear of the watermark). 2012 Scott US$450.00=	$450.00	$60.00
386
27	Canada #22ii // 28i. Decent looking but faulty used study group of 22 Large Queens, all identified in detail for shades, papers and perfs. An excellent group for the Large Queen specialist.

1514
30	Canada #34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43. Mostly mint selection of half cent to 6c Small Queens, very mixed condition (they run from OG NH to no gum thinned). A decent starter lot as you can upgrade some of the problematic stamps later. 2012 Scott US$2,177.50=	$2,177.50	$110.00
4837

1683
32	Canada #35 // 273 plus Back of the Book. Four pages with 95 *extremely* faulty stamps. High catalogue value but bid accordingly for condition. 2012 Scott US$1,735.75=	$1,735.75	$30.00
4947
33	Canada #38a. VF mint example of the 5c slate green Small Queen in the rare perf 11.5 x 12. Only traces of OG remain. Still a sound and attractive Victorian era rarity. Unitrade is $1,500.00 for VF mint. 2012 Scott US$1,100.00=	$1,100.00	$375.00
4462

Catalogued as basic Scott listed stamps. 2012 Scott US$2,325.00=	$2,325.00	$210.00
1514
35	Canada #50-54, 56, 58. Mint hinged septet of 1897 Jubilee issues. The 1c value has a tiny thin (cat $22.50) but the balance are all Fine or better. 2012 Scott US$625.00=	$625.00	$65.00
2546

1683
38	Canada #55i. F/VF lightly cancelled used example of the 6c yellow brown 1897 Jubilee issue showing a clear re-entry in "postage" and the old Queen's crown.

4247
39	Canada #59i. Deep vermilion shade of the 1897 issue 20c Jubilee. F/VF mint LH. Catalogued by Scott as the basic vermilion shade. 2012 Scott US$275.00=	$275.00	$55.00

2409
63	Canada #203. VF mint LH plate #1 plate block of the 1933 issue Grain Exhibition overprint on the 20c Harvester. The Unitrade catalogue as 2 NH and 2 LH VF stamps is $360.00 so I find the lower price for a hinged plate block a bit puzzling. 2012 Unitrade.	$300.00	$75.00
4410
