Bidboard Number: 1944
Date Closed: Wednesday, January 10, 2024 at 05:00:00 PM
Lot #	Description	Cat. Val./Est.	Price Realized
1	Africa - Basutoland to Zimbabwe. Bankers box containing 5 home-made boxes from a vest pocket dealer’s stock, with stamps from many different African nations including Chad, Kenya, KUT, Libya, Mali, Sudan, Rhodesia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zambia and Zaire (plus many more). There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 3000x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 6,000 stamps. The stamps appear to be in decent condition, but as to be expected, most of the material is more common but goes up to about 2005 and includes some back of the book material. Estimate =	$150.00	$85.00
4855
2	Africa - Less often seen countries, with colourful and often topically themed stamps. This is the balance of a consignment, with lots of interesting material. Includes Somalia, Sudan, Liberia, Libya, Guinea and lots of Ethiopia and Abyssinia. Both mint and used, some duplication. Probably over 1000 stamps, almost all 20th century issues. Estimate =	$130.00	$220.00
3961
3	Albania - Attractive Adriatic grouping of collections, bidboard lots and dealer stock covering the period of 1913-1969. Bought over a number of years and then set aside, with much of the material here just as purchased in original packaging. There is a nice smattering of the 1913 "Eagle" issue, including different printings, overprints and probably some forgeries/reprints. The "Scenic" issue of 1923 and its overprints are present, but between 1938-1969 the coverage is individually spotty. The group finalizes with a nice offering of "back of the book" (special delivery, postage dues). Estimate =	$150.00	$170.00
6032
4	Australia #1/1162. Plus "Back of the Book" and Cocos Keeling (Keeling) #1-31. Mostly mint Never Hinged 1913 to 1989 period collection (some used in earlies noted), all housed in a high quality Lighthouse SF (Hingeless) album with matching slipcase. Sparse in 'Roos and early GeoV Heads, the collection starts to get "meaty" in the 1930s and becomes very comprehensive in the 1950s and 1960s. Better Never Hinged material includes the high value "Arms" set, the pre-decimal "Navigators" set and much more. The overall quality is very high but note that the 5sh Sydney Bridge does have a small thin. A run of early Norfolk Island (Scott catalogue US$42.25) rounds out the lot. Exceptional basis for expansion, loaded with quality stamps. Total 2024 Scott US$3,036.00 =	$4,098.60	$675.00
4588
5	Australia #1/1375. A group that proves you don’t judge a collection by its pages. A very thorough used collection of early Australia up to 1994, with lots of potential in the "Roos" and GeoV "Head" issues (a quick check about the notations appears that most are correctly identified). Better values include lots of first Watermark "Roos" and later denominations up to 10/-, followed by a very good run of GeoV with "heads" up to 1/4, Robes and Navigators to £1 and Arms to £2. There is very good coverage from the 1940’s onwards, including moderate amounts of duplication in the later years, but no "back of the book" is present The odd small fault noted, but overall a fairly clean offering. Estimate =	$250.00	$120.00
4236
6	Australia #236/852. Archivally fresh, Very Fine and mint Never Hinged 1950 to 1982 period collection of 533 all different stamps and souvenir sheets. All housed on Hingeless printed "Seven Seas" album pages. The pages are complete from the first issues of 1913 and are in a single volume "Seven Seas" binder with marching slipcase (retail value of the album and pages alone is over $200.00). All originally purchased as "new issues". While not a complete run, the collection does include the pre-decimal "Navigators" set plus other better sets and singles. The second volume of this collection is the next lot. 2024 Scott US$833.00 =	$1,124.55	$160.00
1315
7	Australia #857/1405 Plus Computer Generated Labels. The second volume of the Australian collection, consisting of an archivally fresh, Very Fine and mint Never Hinged 1982 to 1994 period decimal currency collection of 690 all different stamps and souvenir sheets. All housed on Hingeless printed "Seven Seas" album pages. The pages are in a single volume "Seven Seas" binder with matching slipcase (retail value of the album and pages alone is over $200.00). All originally purchased as "new issues". 2024 Scott US$832.90 =	$1,124.42	$160.00
1315
8	Australian States - Six Hagner stockpages with 724 overwhelmingly used stamps from each of Australia’s six stamp issuing states: New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The accumulator of this lot started organizing them by denomination, with the intent of separating out printings, shades, perforations later. A quick glance indicates that there is a good diversity of printings, as well as many readable cancels. Unchecked by us. Duplication of design gets heavy at times. Conservatively estimated at less than 20c a stamp! Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00
5841
9	Australian States - Western Australia #1/61. Selection of 32 used (plus four mint) stamps from 1874 to 1888 period in mainly sound and very collectible condition. Identification by consignor, as noted for each stamp. The one shilling #24 was punch cancelled (telegraph) and has a patch added on the back. It greatly improves the appearance but would fool no one. An excellent start on the earlies of this popular Australian state. Owner's 2023 Scott US$1,448.25 =	$1,955.14	$160.00
4236
10	Austria - Revenue collection pulled from 1970’s dealer stock. Lot includes over 250 mostly different (about 80% used) in excellent condition given their age and the very thin paper used on the 19th century "stemple-marke" issues. A nice range of revenue types, issues and denominations. Most are properly used, with a few still on-piece and we noted only one with a punch hole "cancel". Very uncommon material. Estimate =	$200.00	$55.00
6025
11	Bahamas #27/718. A quintet of collections and accumulations covering the Victorian era up to the early 1990’s. Some of the more notable material includes the "Seal of the Colony" (2 sets with dates), KGV definitives to 5/- and lots of commemorative sets in the Elizabethan era. A mix of mint (hinged) and used throughout the approximately 500 stamps, with some light duplication. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
3634
12	Barbuda #1-11. Complete Mint hinge-remnant set of the GeoV 1922 Leeward Islands OVPT "BARBUDA" with additional "SPECIMEN" overprint in black.

Listed in Scott Specialized catalogue. 2022 Scott Specialized US$260.00 =	$351.00	$120.00
6175
13	Belgium #222/389, B179/B662a. Powerful double sided stockpage containing 91 different mint NH stamps and 1 souvenir sheet, plus 9 used issues, almost all being in complete sets. Very clean material, neatly arranged by the previous owner and contains mint #251-253, B189-196, B426-431, B442-446, B511-513, B555-557, B579-585 and B662a and used B468-476. Take a good look at the scans to appreciate the high-quality of the lot. Owner's 2021 Scott over US$1000.00 =	$1,350.00	$180.00
6087
14	Belgium - A collector's accumulation of mint and (mostly) used material from "earlies" to the 2000's neatly arranged on 23 stockpages (mostly Vario brand) within a small binder. Noted a nice array of material including some better "back of the book" issues. Condition is a bit mixed in the earlier mateiral, but it is neatly laid out on the pages for easy inspection. Estimate =	$120.00	$50.00
269
15	Bermuda #1/9 Plus Shades. All used, generally sound and Fine to Very Fine selection of fourteen 1865 to 1903 period issues, consisting of the perf 14 x 14 and the perf14 x 12½ types, all watermark 1 (Crown and CC).

3683
17	Bermuda #16-39 plus shades. Carefully organized selection of used 1880 to 1910 Queen Victoria and Edward VII period issues, including numerous shades of certain values. While these better shades are all listed in the Scott Classic catalogue, all the stamps have been conservatively valued as the basic (and less expensive) listed varieties. 2023 Scott Classic US$226.60 =	$305.91	$40.00
3543

Footnoted in Scott after #46 (paraphrased) "No.31 with overprint were prepared but not issued. Value $62.50".

3634
31	British Africa - Gold Coast, Zanzibar, Sierra Leone and Somaliland Protectorate on an assortment of old album pages and stockcards. Gold Coast has the strongest showing in used QV, with lots of cancel potential. The Zanzibar is mostly mint, while the Sierra Leone has both used classics and a bit of more modern mint issues. Last but not least is some fresh-looking Somaliland (QV, KEVII, GeoV and the first set of QEII, all mint). Attractive, with a bit of minor duplication. Estimate =	$130.00	$170.00
3408
32	British America - Anguilla to Virgin Islands dealer stock. Three home-made dealer boxes filled with stamps in glassines with notable material from Antigua, Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman, Granada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago (but with representation from many other countries as well). A mix of mint and used stamps, sorted by country and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. There are anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine and our conservative guess is that there are 1600x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 4,000 stamps and the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps appear to be in decent condition with a good range of material, starting with the 19th century up to about 2005 with some back of the book material. Estimate =	$150.00	$80.00
6372
33	British Carribean - A commonwealth accumulation of "saints", The group includes 1) St. Kitts (with and without Nevis) with a couple nice complete mint KGVI sets and some overprinted sets from the separation. 2) St. Lucia, a few classics alongside a few modern sets with some good topical interest. 3) St. Vincent, with everything from the "classics" to modern Disney topicals. 4) Finally, to break the cycle, there is also some Dominica material here. All bought from multiple sources over a number of years and then never touched. Estimate =	$140.00	$75.00
4466
34	British Carribean - An accumulation from a collector that loved this region and often bought from auctions or dealers, but never took the time to straighten his purchases out. Strength of this lot is the British Honduras/Belize (including an attractive mint copy of #23). We noted some mint Grenada (1970-1972) and a card of used earlies. There is a bit of Antigua, Barbuda, some Anguilla (including early overprints), a touch of Jamaica and a couple of pages of colourful sea life topicals from around the Caribbean. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
4466
35	British Carribean - Smatterings from a consignors purchases over a number of years, most untouched since they were purchased. Strength is easily Barbados with Seal of the Colony up to 2/-, and with more modern, such as the Orchid definitive set. There is also notable Turks & Caicos Islands (including the last GeoVI set, cat $97.00), British Virgin Islands (complete sheets of 50, with gutter, of the 1981 Duke of Edinburgh award), and there bits and pieces from a couple other colonies. Expect disorganization and a bit of duplication, but the condition overall looks good and there is definitely the possibility of a few hidden gems for the intrepid collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$80.00
4466
36	British Commonwealth - A "G to S" smattering of mostly mint (some used) GeoVI era issues from a random grouping of countries. Some stamps of note are Gambia (#132/143), Gibraltar (#108/117), KUT (#85), New Zealand (Centennial and Health issues), Northern Rhodesia (#25/45), Sarawak (#180/195), Sierra Leone (#173/185), Somaliland (#96/107, 116/126), Sudan (#63/94) and a good range of South Africa / South West Africa. In addition to the before-mentioned notable stamps, there are also "common design" issues and "back of the book" (semi-postals, dues, officials) from these countries. While the mint stamps are often heavily hinged and sets are often a mix of mint and used, they still have a great appearance, with lots to be salvaged here (but make no expectations about the album, it is has seen better days) Total 2023 Scott US$1244.60 =	$1,680.21	$200.00
4466
37	British Commonwealth - Envelope box with modern Falkland Islands, Ascension (includes QEII birds definitives), Nevis, a large packet of used Malta, Churchill birth Centenary, QEII Silver Jubilee,and the Princess Diana (Wedding, Birthday, etc). We noted a page of 27 different stamps of the 1935 common design issue and a few sets from the 1949 UPU issue. There is also a photo album with about 130 heavily duplicated souvenir sheets from Great Britain, South West Africa, Falklands, etc. Several hundred dollars of catalogue here, but in need of a good sort. Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00
2712
38	British Commonwealth - Omnibus Issue Group Quartet. Nearly complete all mint Hinged/Never Hinged runs of four different Commonwealth omnibus sets, consisting of: the 1937 GeoVI Coronation series (only missing the Newfoundland issues); the 1946 Peace/Victory series (missing only the GB and Morocco Agencies issues); the 1953 QEII Coronation series (missing only Malaya - Penang); and the 1965 International Cooperation Year series (missing only the French New Hebrides). All neatly laid out on numerous Vario brand stock sheets. These have all been organized and catalogued by the consignor using the 2014/2015/2016 Scott catalogues. Owner's Scott US$486.50 =	$656.78	$120.00

These specimen sets were often used in Post Office presentation packages for foreign officials and Post Offices. Although Scott Classic has started to value these Specimen sets (often at hefty premium over the regular issues), this set has not been valued and therefore catalogued as a basic NH set only. 2023 Scott for the basic set US$180.00 =	$243.00	$75.00
6175

All complete sets from the GeoV, GeoVI and QEII period and a nearly complete run from 1935 up to 1967, with several additional Scott listed varieties also included. 2024 Scott US$321.90 =	$434.56	$95.00

50	British West Indies - Over a dozen former bidboard auction lots, from several colonies, offered as originally purchased and awaiting your sorting skills. Better items include Barbados 1897 Britannia 2sh6d value nicely used, Antigua GeoV short set to 4/-, a nice offering of QV Turks and Caicos and British Honduras. This is only a small fraction of this lot, which includes single page offerings of Montserrat, Bermuda, Virgin Islands, Barbados, Dominica, St. Kitts, Anguilla. There is also a mounted offering of Montserrat officials, Belize and Anguilla. Finally topped off with a handful of "102" cards with Bermuda which include early issues up to the early 2000’s. We estimate there is easily over US$1000.00 Scott catalogue value here. Estimate =	$200.00	$190.00
4466
51	Brunei #62/127. Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged selection of 60 different 1947 to 1966 period issues, almost all in complete sets. Great topicals, omnibus issues and high value sets. 2024 Scott US$262.35 =	$354.17	$55.00
6372
52	Brunei #N1, N3-N5, N7, N10-N12, N15-N17. Japanese Occupation Issues. F/VF Mint Never Hinged group of 11 different overprinted issues from the 1942-1944 Japanese occupation period. Tough to find material. 2023 Scott US$405.00 =	$546.75	$170.00
5495
53	Canada #1. Very Fine used four margin 7-ring target cancelled example of the 1851 issue 3p Beaver imperf on horizontally laid paper. An attractive example of this classic Canadian First Issue. Unitrade is $1,600.00 for Very Fine used. 2024 Scott US$1,200.00 =	$1,620.00	$400.00
6035
54	Canada #2. Sound and F/VF used example of the 1851 issue 6p Consort on vertically laid paper. Margins large to close. Light partial 7-ring target cancel in blue. An attractive and fault-free Canadian pence issue classic. Comes with a 2012 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states (in part) "genuine in all respects". 2024 Scott US$1,500.00 =	$2,025.00	$500.00
6268
55	Canada #4, 4d. Two used examples of the 3 penny beaver imperf, one on regular wove paper, the other on thin paper. Both in Very Good/Fine condition, otherwise sound. A decent reference pair. 2024 Scott US$425.00 =	$573.75	$85.00
6136
56	Canada #5. Sound used example of the 1855 issue 6p slate grey Consort imperforate on wove paper. The margins are huge to just touching, lightly cancelled. Comes with a 2012 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states (in part) "genuine, small stain on reverse shows on front in the hair" (not particularly noticeable). 2024 Scott US$1,150.00 =	$1,552.50	$500.00
649
57	Canada #7. Sound and lightly cancelled used example of the 1855 issue 10p blue Jacques Cartier imperf on thin crisp paper. An attractive pence era item. 2024 Scott US$1,500.00 =	$2,025.00	$425.00
6035
58	Canada #8. Sound and Fine to Very Fine used example of the half penny rose 1857 issue Queen Victoria imperf. Clear and full strike of the "21" 4-ring numeral cancel (Montreal). Margins range from huge to just touching. A great looking stamp! 2024 Scott US$700.00 =	$945.00	$260.00
6035
59	Canada #8/102. Selection of Canadian classics. Assembly of 56 used stamps, starting with a 1/2d QV imperf and a perforated 3d Beaver (missing only 5% of the stamp) and includes a set of perforated "Cents", a smattering of Large Queens and a good representation of the 5c, 6c, and 8c Small Queens along with 5 examples of the 10c (including 2 pairs). This is all followed with Maps / Tercentenary issues, including a 2c Map Stamp that has a December 24, 1898 "Clinton Street Toronto" CDS cancel. The 5c-15c Quebec Tercentenary are all Socked on the Nose with a nice Montreal Station C, 3-ring Orb cancels. The early issues are in particularly rough shape, but condition improves into the 20th century, with several that could use a soak to clean them up a bit. The Scott catalogue value of the page is over $4,000.00 but because of condition issues, we decided to estimate this grouping. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
3556
60	Canada #14/28 Sampler. All used mixed condition (expect some faults) selection of nine First Cents/Large Queens issues. All valued as least expensive varieties. A good lot for the Classic Canada collector. 2024 Scott US$1,025.00 =	$1,383.75	$95.00
4451
61	Canada #9. Sound used 1857 issue 7½p green Queen Victoria imperforate on wove paper. Margins clear to just in. Rich deep colour, light and unobtrusive cancel. A great looking early Canadian Classic. 2024 Scott US$3,000.00 =	$4,050.00	$625.00
5849
62	Canada #11. The rare 1858 half penny rose perforated pence issue, sound and Very Fine used. Very light "8" four-ring numeral cancel (Chatham U.C.). Only issued for a very short period of time and missing from most collections we see. 2024 Scott US$1,500.00 =	$2,025.00	$675.00
6035
63	Canada #12. The elusive 1858 issue 3 penny "Beaver" perforated pence, sound and Fine to Very Fine used. Very light cancel. Only issued for a very short period of time and very hard to find as nice as this. 2024 Scott US$1,400.00 =	$1,890.00	$475.00
6035
64	Canada #14/1896. Two volume used collection from the "Cents" up to the 47c era. The first thing that you will notice is that the album isn’t much, but it starts with some attractive QV-era material. The #15 has a nice inscription in the lower margin, the 1c yellow Large Queen has a 2-ring "53" cancel (Trois Rivieres – Unitrade RF 5: Scarce). Then there is a nice smattering of Small Queens including the Widow Weeds, Jubilees ½ c to 8c, complete Leaf / Numeral / Edwards, Quebec to 10c and most of the GeoV sets to the dollar value (including a nice Bluenose). The "back of the book" includes O9 (a bit grubby), as well as other "G" and "OHMS" overprints and basic Airmail and Special Delivery sets which are complete. After the before-mentioned material, there is still another 80 years worth of stamps! Among the 2000+ stamps, there is some duplication, especially in later years. Condition is going to be mixed, and the visibly faulty stamps aren’t counted. There is lots of mining to be done here and we have only catalogued up to the end of the GeoV era (and the "back of the book"). Total 2023 Scott US$3852.85 =	$5,201.35	$190.00
5977
65	Canada #14/2034. Harris Canada album with pages up to 2004 houses a bit of an eclectic mixed collection that runs hot and cold on mint and used. The Victorian and Edwardian eras are a bit light, but noted values up to 10c & 50c respectively. The collection really gets going with GeoV, including sets to the dollar value with some of the lower values being mint (although we did note a GeoV "Champlain dollar" that is very lightly hinged). The Elizabethan era is very complete and up to about 1984 is mostly mint, followed then with the final 20 years of the collection being mostly postally used. There are some nice booklet panes which include a mint copy of #105a, some mint and used GeoVI War issue booklets and some attractive QEII Cameo and Centennial panes. The back of the book includes C1-9 mint, E2/E11 mint and used and a few better G/OHMS official overprints. Expect the mint to be fairly heavily hinged, but with decent centering and appearance. About 1800 stamps in total. Estimate =	$250.00	$95.00
5977
66	Canada #18TCv. Rare imperforate trial colour proof in black with vertical "SPECIMEN" (Type A) in carmine of the 1859 issue 12½c Victoria from the first decimal currency series. Only 50 examples of this proof were printed. As an added bonus, this sound and choice quality upper sheet margin proof comes with a 2015 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states, in part, "genuine in all respects". Considering how few were printed, we feel that it is severely undervalued in Unitrade, particularly for an example as nice as this. 2024 Unitrade =	$650.00	$575.00
4464
67	Canada #26: Shades, Perfs and Papers. Generally sound and Fine to Very Fine selection of ten used examples of the 1875 issue 5c olive green Large Queen. While you can expect to find the odd fault, the lot is unchecked for papers, shades or perfs. Valued as the most common basic stamps by Scott. 2024 Scott US$2,250.00 =	$3,037.50	$160.00
3634
68	Canada #29/30 Study Group. All used selection of twenty-two grey violet/red lilac/grey/blue grey (and many other shades) 15c Large Queens, generally in sound and Fine to Very Fine condition (but expect some faults). All conservatively valued as basic Scott listed stamps. Unchecked for papers, perfs or varieties. Lots of things to research here with a rewarding and decent upside for the Large Queen specialist. All neatly laid out on one Hagner stock sheet to facilitate inspection. 2024 Scott US$1,320.00 =	$1,782.00	$130.00
4227
69	Canada #34/45, 66/73, 75/85, 89-95, 90A. Decent selection of 36 almost all different (2 x #45) used 1870 to 1908 period Victorian and Edwardian era stamps, all laid out on one Hagner brand stock sheet. Expect the odd fault but in general a sound and attractive "starter" group. 2024 Scott US$893.65=	$1,206.43	$32.00
6536
70	Canada #35/2307. Comprehensive two-volume collection of used Canada from the Small Queens up to 2009. Includes both the 20c and 50c Widow Weeds and 1c-5c Jubilees. Then, from the QV Leaf issue onwards is very complete, including the Leaf, Numeral, KEVII, Quebec, Admiral (including both overprints and a pair of MR2Bi), Confederation, Scroll and Arch sets. Commemoratives and definitives are very complete up to about 2005. The back of the book is a bit spotty, but noted some dues and "OHMS" / "G" overprints. The occasional bit of duplication, but a significant means to build or improve a collection, or to breakup for resale. About 2000 stamps in total. 2023 Scott US$2893.15 =	$3,905.55	$140.00
6300
71	Canada #51/99. Never Hinged Wholesale Group. Generally sound and Fine all mint Never Hinged duplicated selection of 1897 to 1908 issue Queen Victoria and Edward VII period issues. All neatly laid out on one Hagner brand stock sheet. 34 stamps in total. A good lot for the dealer looking for early Never Hinged material. 2024 Scott US$3,345.50 =	$4,516.43	$110.00
5977
72	Canada #53. Cancels: Late Queen Victoria Period Selection. Group of used ninety 1897 to 1902 issue Victorian issues, including Jubilees, Leafs and Numerals, all chosen for cancel interest. Noted clear examples of Fancy Corks, Crowns, Registrations, targets, rollers, precancels and more. Lots to research and identify here. The lot includes better individual higher catalogue value items but expect to find the odd fault. All laid out on two Hagner brand stock sheets for easy inspection. Estimate =	$250.00	$120.00
6025
73	Canada #58, 59, 60. Mint examples of the 15c steel blue, 20c vermilion and 50c ultramarine 1897 QV Jubilees. The #58 is Hinged (corner creases upper right), the #59 is fresh and Lightly Hinged, the #60 is sound and Fine no gum. 2024 Scott US$975.00 =	$1,316.25	$190.00

6519

6519

649
79	Canada #65. Nicely centered used example of the 1897 issue $5.00 olive green QV Jubilee high value, light smudge cancel. Parcel post usage of the dollar value Jubilees was very common. 2024 Scott US$1,000.00 =	$1,350.00	$325.00
6519
80	Canada #66-73. Complete Fine mint Hinged set of the 1897-1898 QV "Leaf" issue, including the 10c brown violet "key-value". An attractive set, with vibrant colours. 2023 Scott US$1455.00 =	$1,964.25	$110.00
3640
81	Canada #85, 86. Shade and variety goldmine. A carefully assembled group of 38 used 1898 issue 2c Xmas Map stamps, all selected for (mostly) Fancy Cork postmarks, including scarce types. The vast majority of the strikes are clear enough to make identification east. The ocean shades run from pale gray to deep blue, with one striking "black ocean": created by natural oxidization. This lot was put together by the collector over a long period of time for cancel interest only and is completely unchecked for re-entries or island varieties. An exceptional and rewarding winter philatelic project. Estimate =	$300.00	$240.00
6012
82	Canada #91. The 1903 issue Edward VII 5c blue on blue, just Very Good/Fine centered but fresh and Never Hinged. 2024 Scott US$800.00=	$1,080.00	$50.00

We noted a $1 Totem used block, paper fluorescent varieties on the QEII Wilding booklet panes, "staple" and "stich" booklet panes and a flurry of different plate number inscription blocks. The mint appears to be a mix of hinged / never-hinged. Take a good look at the photos to appreciate the scope of the lot. Estimate =	$170.00	$42.00
3613
107	Canada #279. All F/VF (with lots of VF noted) sextet of mint NH strips of four of the scarcer perf 9½ type of the 2c brown GeoVI War issue coil. A superior quality group. 2024 Scott US$504.00 =	$680.40	$44.00

113	Canada #340iii VARIETY. Mint Never Hinged lower right corner block of four of the 1954 issue 4c violet QEII "Wilding" on a distinctive HIBRITE paper but without the vertical ribbing as noted in Unitrade.

114	Canada #404b, 404bi. Mint Never Hinged miniature panes of 25 of the 1963 issue 4c carmine QEII Cameo, one on regular paper, the other on the rare fluorescent paper. Nice to have both papers at the same time for comparison purposes. 2024 Unitrade =	$514.00	$170.00

They appear to be DF and NF papers, like the untagged panes but are unlisted in Unitrade as having different papers when Tagged. It's not often that we turn up potentially new Centennial listings! Estimate =	$250.00	$150.00
6529

119	Canada #1250ii. Upper right position mint inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative. Never Hinged but with a small area of gum disturbance in margin noted for the record. Most inscription blocks were withdrawn due to problematic and incredibly poor printing quality.

4249

Attractive page of "back of the book", including complete sets of Canada’s Airmail, Special Delivery, Special Delivery Airmail and Registration stamps and the first set of Postage Dues.

6330
123	Canada #F1-F2 Study Group. All used selection of 2c and 5c Registration stamps, almost all collected for cancel interest by the original collector over a period of years (decades).

6012
127	Canada #MR2B, MR2Bi, MR2C. Mint Hinged examples of three 1915 issue "WAR TAX" or "INLAND REVENUE / WAR TAX" provisionally overprinted postal/fiscal Admirals consisting of two different 5c blue (both Fine Hinged) and a 20c olive green (Very Fine Hinged). 2023 Unitrade =	$450.00	$85.00

Conservatively valued by Scott Classic catalogue, with no premiums added for varieties, centering, perfin positions or "missing pins". 2023 Scott Classic US$564.50 =	$762.08	$130.00
347
131	Canada #OX4. Fresh, sound and Fine mint Never Hinged block of four of the 1913 issue brown black Officially Sealed stamp. All the stamps with perfect gum. Multiples of this official seal are very scarce. 2024 Scott US$1,800.00=	$2,430.00	$280.00

6300
133	Canada - Annual Collections for 1976-1984, 1987. Ten different editions of Canada Post yearbooks, all in Very Fine condition, all of them intact in the original boxes or plastic wrap. These Canada Post publications contain the mint NH stamps, souvenir sheets and booklets for these ten years. A top quality group of these impressive and informative publications. Total face value of the mint NH stamps, panes and souvenir sheets in the seven volumes is $117.30. 2023 Unitrade =	$430.00	$48.00
5979
134	Canada - Back of the Book Mini-Hoard. Modernish (mostly 1940s to 1970s) period mint Hinged/Never Hinged accumulation of "Back of the Book" issues, mostly in blocks/plate blocks including 1976 Olympic Semi-postals, airmails (1935 issue and up), Special Deliveries (1935 issue and up), Airmail Special Deliveries and Postage Dues (last issue "purples" and various "Reds") and Officials (later "G" types).

Estimate =	$180.00	$120.00
6541
135	Canada - Dealer stock of early 2000's up to 2015 issues, mostly used off-paper and neatly arranged on a dozen stocksheets. A duplicated selection of 1156 stamps, including many "P" values. 2023 Unitrade =	$489.95	$55.00
5979
136	Canada - HARDCOVER Annual Collections for 1987 and 1988. Very Fine condition set of two Canada Post issued annual collections, consisting of the much scarcer Hardcover editions with matching slipcases. Undervalued in Unitrade considering how infrequently we come across them. 2024 Unitrade =	$135.00	$90.00
269
137	Canada - Kiloware. Bankers box containing 20lbs of mostly modern mix of close-cut on single paper and off-paper kiloware, including a lightly used example of the 2023 Unitrade Specialized Catalogue of Canadian Stamps. A good lot in need of a sort, likely with some hidden gems to be found throughout. Estimate =	$120.00	$120.00
5841
138	Canada - Local Post / Private Courier Mail. An accumulation of 131 "British Columbia Private Courrier" labels, used on piece. This local post service offered a cross-border mail alternative the Canada Post, offered primarily during the various Post Office strikes of the 1980's. Operated by Shultze Stamps out of Victoria BC, the sender could pay for the private service of having their mail carried across the border to Washington State (and vice-versa) to be processed using the United States USPS postal service. A duplicated selection (as there are 23 different in total), but with a wide-variety of postmarks to add to the intrigue. All neatly laid-out on Vario brand stockpages. Listed in both the Lafreniere and Covert catalogues. Estimate =	$140.00	$34.00
5979
139	Canada - Massive "Meat on the Bones" Balance of Sales Pages. Hundreds of 19th to mid-20th century mint (mostly Hinged) and used stamps, all still mounted on individual remaindered APS approval pages that were prepared by the collector in the 1990s. Loads of better stamps noted in the mix including Jubilees, Edwards, Tercentenaries, Admirals, GeoV and GeoVI dollar values, good "Back of the Book" and much more. An exceptional opportunity for the stamp show or internet dealer. Thousands of dollars of total retail here, with an exceptionally useful range of issues. Take a good look at the scans so you don't miss out on this "offered as received" old-time lot. Estimate =	$750.00	$925.00
6301
140	Canada - Medley of (mostly) mint arranged on 67 Vario brand stocksheets (and about a dozed 4-pocket pages) within a binder.

There is also a smattering of used material and some foreign material at the back. Conservatively valued for ONLY the usable Canadian mint face value stamps, but the used / foreign / Vario pages (stockpages alone would retail for over $130.00) should be taken into consideration. Total face value =	$601.69	$400.00
5966
141	Canada - Mint and Used 1992-2003 Collection in Two Lindner Albums. Parallel mint Never Hinged and used 1992 to 2003 period collection of hundreds of stamps, booklet panes and souvenir sheets, all housed in two Lindner albums with Hingeless pages running from 1992 to 2003 (pages 127 through 230). The stamps in the two volumes are laid out with the mint Never Hinged stamps housed in the protective clear plastic pockets and with the used stamps Hinged on the pages behind the protective plastic pages. The two Lindner albums and pages themselves retail for over $250.00 new and the catalogue value of the used stamps should also be taken into account. Very conservatively valued for the useable mint face value postage but worth much more. Total face value =	$444.54	$325.00
6000
142	Canada - Mint Stock 1930s to 1990s Mix. Clean and carefully stored duplicated Very Fine mint and mostly Never Hinged singles, with additional blocks, booklets and souvenir sheets all housed in one fat Uni-Safe stockbook. Face values range from 1c to 80c, with the 1940s to 1990s period rates of 5c to 43c comprising the bulk of the lot. Huge sixty decade+ range of issues noted, including numerous Unitrade listed varieties, better singles, semi-postals and other "Back of the Book" issues, with nicely balanced duplication. A great lot for the mail order dealer. Conservatively valued as face value postage only. Total face value =	$379.20	$230.00
6039

6039
145	Canada - Modern COVID period issues, selection of 124 different including the "Merci - Flying Postal Truck" stamp issued only to postal employees and five personal picture postage issues. Modern used material is increasingly hard to find. Estimate =	$150.00	$150.00
4249
146	Canada - Modern used commemorative issue "kiloware". One pound (1lb) of COVID period issues and into 2023 used on close-cut single paper, likely with about 1400-1500 stamps in total. Clean selected material, in which we did not see any "pen cancels". About 90% of this mix will fall into the COVID period, 2020-2022 where postally used commemorative issues were seldom used. Increasingly tough to find material. Estimate =	$150.00	$425.00
1786
147	Canada - Pair of 3-ring binders, packed with manila stocksheets, which themselves are filled with mostly used stamps (Small queen up to around 1960). Among the inevitable common material are some pockets of strength. In no particular order are notable "back of the book" (a number of E3 with readable CDS cancels), 3x 8c/10c Jubilees, a bunch of 8c QV leaf and some GeoVI/early QEII complete booklets (over $100.00 catalogue value here). There are a number of used blocks in the latter part of the stock (including a Kitimat - Nechako Centre CDS cancel for the postmark hounds). Significant catalogue value here, a picker’s paradise! Estimate =	$130.00	$95.00
4453
148	Canada - Perfin perfection! Attractive mounted collection on homemade pages of Canada (mostly) and Newfoundland with over 900 stamps with corporate perforated initials, strength in GeoV era. Includes larger and smaller companies, including Ayre & Sons, Bell Telephone, International Harvester and MANY from Railways, Insurers, Banks and Provincial Agencies. Lightly duplicated, but includes lots of medium value stamps (even noted three on precancelled stamps). Identified by old Johnson numbers. Overall condition is better than average. Estimate =	$200.00	$250.00
5567
149	Canada - Private Perfin Hoard. A small container containing glassines of perfin stamps, QV to QEII with the majority being GeoV / GeoVI and QEII. Organized by the previous owner, most of the companies seem to be identified on the glassines but with some "unsorted" and "unknown" packets included. We counted the stamps and were pleasantly surprised as they totaled up to 4494! While the lesser-seen company perfins seem to have 1-2 examples, the larger companies (CPR / CNR / Province Saskatchewan / Bell Telephone) have much larger packets. Seemingly unchecked for perfin varieties, positions, better stamps and multiples. A wonderful old-time hoard to be sorted. Estimate =	$200.00	$500.00
3016
150	Canada - QEII Era Mint Accumulation. An array of singles, blocks, plate blocks primarily from the early QEII era, but also including a bit of earlier and later material (up to the "Edible Berries" definitive issues). Lots of plus-values items throughout including numerous plate number inscription blocks of the QEII Wilding / QEII Karsh issues and paper / tagging varieties on the QEII Karsh and Centennial issues. We did not several blocks that were noted "no gum", but overall an interesting group to sort through, offered as received. Conservatively valued by the total useable postage / face value only. Total face value =	$301.98	$230.00
6039
151	Canada - QEII Mint accumulation of stamps 1955-2008. A collector’s mailing postage stash, which includes lots of lower value souvenir sheets (54c-57c era), some booklets (not all are complete, a bit of "P" value material and lots from the 5c-17c era. The condition is a bit mixed, so just be warned if you are going to purchase this to expand your collection. Moderate to heavy duplication, but the face value adds up quickly. Conservatively valued for the total face value of the usable postage. Total face value =	$493.05	$350.00
5966
152	Canada - Red dealer box, half-filled and containing a somewhat disorganized group of glassines and "102" cards from a well-known dealer’s stock, starting with GeoV issues and going up to the early 1980’s. The material is generally "non-traditional" stock with coils (including "score-line" blocks from the 1970’s), War era to Centennial booklets (complete and panes), GeoVI plate blocks, Elizabethan-era varieties (papers, minor print shifts) as well as some "Back of the Book". Mostly mint, 90% of which is never hinged, and a bit of used. Overall condition is excellent, with a bit of duplication. It won’t take much effort to process this for online sale. Estimate =	$300.00	$500.00
6541
153	Canada - Stamp and Cover Lot. Double height pizza box containing QEII era semi-organized specialized collections consisting of Wilding and Cameo issues as well as Christmas stamps, along with a smaller carton containing around 150 Canadian First Day Covers, Special Event Covers and souvenir cards. Estimate =	$150.00	$95.00
5440
154	Canada - Two volume mostly mint collection on Harris pages, focused on the period of 1990-2009. Virtually complete commemoratives for the period, including lots of sets, souvenir sheets, complete booklets and high-values (noted the Montreal Canadiens $9 "3-D" sheetlet). The definitives go up to the $8 Grizzly and are a basic representation of the issues of this period (unchecked by us for perforations or paper types). Overall condition is good, however a number of the stamps are hinged and some of the souvenir sheets and booklets are adhered to the pages... the stamps will be fine, but we won’t make any promises about the selvedge and booklet covers. Great to build a collection from this time period, to fill in holes or to use as postage as the mint stamps add up quicky! Conservatively valued for the useable postage face value only. Total face value =	$902.06	$425.00
6039
155	Canada Cancels - A multi-part selection of postmark material, carefully sorted and arranged by the consignor. In no particular order, the lot includes... 1) Saskatchewan cancels, with 6 pages that feature over 75 MOON cancels on stamp or piece. 2) Two stockpages with 90 SON (socked-on-the-nose) CDS cancels on #363, the 25c Chemical issue. 3) Two stockpages with 125 SON (socked-on-the-nose) CDS cancels on primarily 1930's stamps from across the country but with strength in BC and SASK. 4) Finally, a couple hundred Canada Cancels, neatly sorted and identified on "102" cards from across the country. A wonderful assortment for the postmark enthusiast. Estimate =	$180.00	$180.00
1393
156	Canada Cancels - Alberta Bound cancel collection overfilling two black 32-page UniSafe stockbooks with approximately 3000 mostly different cancels on stamp or piece. Almost exclusively QEII era with strength between 1980-2010, including many rubber "POCON" cancels which would make for a great basis for a research study. Heavy coverage from around the province, including a good mix of Calgary and Edmonton sub offices and a number of cancels from the early 1990’s when Post Office numbers and status were often very short-lived. Estimate =	$350.00	$210.00
3619
157	Canada Cancels - Collectors QV to QEII selection of 965 cancels on stamp, piece or cut-sqaure from across the country mounted on home-made pages within a binder. Neatly hinged on pages, often by stamp issue or Province, this selection includes MANY better strikes throughout. While the somewhat spread-out appearance of this grouping might make it a bit tough to view, there is notable strength in Western Canada (in particular Saskatchewan) and closed Post Offices of New Brunswick. While the Victorian material is limited, we did not a few pages including a bakers dozen (13) of 1898 "Map Stamps". Great material for the postmark collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$120.00
5839
158	Canada Cancels - Group of 102 "back of the book" #C1-C7 airmail issues, each with a SON (socked-on-the-nose) CDS town postmark. Mostly nice strikes, with the overall quality well above average. Cataloged by the consignor at the lowest possible Unitrade value (2024 Unitrade $197.00). Estimate =	$120.00	$48.00
3773
159	Canada Covers #926A/1901. First Day Cover collection in five 3-ring binders, each filled with FDC’s issued between 1985-2001. A total of 481 Canada Post cacheted unaddressed covers, including some se-tenant, plate blocks, sheetlets and souvenir sheets. Noted some higher denomination covers, including a duo of $8 Grizzly FDC. Overall condition of the covers is generally excellent (the binders not so much), with some mild duplication of up to three of a type. Some addition material is also present (mostly from the earlier years into about 1992) and includes new issue brochures or postcards and a number of privately produced uncacheted FDCs (some with Ottawa, some with BC cancels). Estimated at only 25c per cove, which is less than the "FDC Post Office Fee" when purchased, which was on top of the face value of the stamps! Estimate =	$120.00	$100.00
5979
160	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. A Vancouver Island quartet of split ring cancels 1904-1912 on cover / postcard. A well-above average group which includes Westholme 1908, Bamfield 1906, Goldstream 1904 and Chase River 1912. Assembled by the original collector for either quality of strike, or rarity of office (and in this case, often both). All are neatly sleeved and priced. Total retail as marked =	$225.00	$65.00
4858
161	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Bear Creek BC 1914 split ring cancel on postcard to Vancouver. An attractive "double strike" of the Bear Creek postmark, with the Post Office only open from October 1913 to May 1917. Neatly arranged for display on the previous owner's album page, complete with Post Office revenues for the period. Ex. Tracy Cooper collection. Estimate =	$250.00	$210.00
1393
162	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Haysport BC 1918 split ring cancel on postcard to Seattle WA, USA. A VF strike of the Haysport postmark, with the Post Office open from 1913-1921 only. Located on the GTP Railway line, at the mouth of the Skeena River, 24 miles southeast of Prince Rupert. Attractively mounted and displayed on collection / exhibit page, complete with Post Office revenue amounts for the duration of Post Office existence. Ex. Tracy Cooper collection. Estimate =	$120.00	$38.00
4858
163	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Kitimat Mission 1927 split ring cancel on postcard to Listowel, Ontario. A nice example of a seldom-seen BC Post Office cancel, seemingly without any Day/Month/Year indicia, but luckily dated on the card by the message (March 18th 1927). A historically interesting location (on the Northern End of Kitimat Arm, North Coast BC), the Post Offices of the area saw a couple variations of spelling before settling on what we know as Kitimat BC today. A tough to find BC postmark. Sleeved and retail priced. Price as marked =	$275.00	$160.00
1393
164	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Specialized grouping of 17 WWII era Military Post Office (MPO) cancels of BC. A much more interesting array of covers than are usually seen, including 1944 Prince Rupert MPO 1110 (large CDS, registered), 1944 Prince Rupert MPO 1110 (MOTO cancel, registered), 1944 Vancouver MPO 1106 CDS (two different covers), 1944 Vancouver MPO 1106 (registered), 1945 Chilliwack MPO 1107 CDS, 1943 Vernon MPO 1101 CDS, 1945 Patricia Bay MPO 1102 CDS, 1943 Victoria MPO 1103 CDS, 1944 Abbotsford MPO 1125 CDS, 1944 Prince George MPO 1108 CDS, 1944 Prince Rupert MPO 1106 CDS, 1943 Terrace MPO 1109 CDS, 1944 Vancouver MPO 1116 CDS, 1945 Tofino MPO 1122CDS, Abbotsford MPO 1125 MOTO and 1945 Alliford Bay MPO 1127 CDS. It would take many years to assemble a similar group of this high-quality again. Estimate =	$200.00	$160.00
1393
165	Canada Covers - British Columbia. A Victoria and Victoria sub-offices cancellation collection, that was in the process of being mounted (possibly for exhibition). Starts with a 6c Small Queen rate to the UK and moves onto some nice squared circle cancels on cover/card (including six to Port Essington, BC). There is a bit of a gap from the Admiral period to the early 1960s and runs to about 2005. Noted postcards, covers (including registered), meters, corner cards and lots of hand cancels (particularly interest in the difficult to find HRIS/POCON cancels from the early 1990’s). About 75 covers and a couple hundred cancels on stamp/piece. A great building block for the BC cancel collector. Estimate =	$160.00	$575.00
5803
166	Canada Covers - Canada Post 1970's to 1990's First Day Cover collection, including a large amount of inscription / plate blocks (including high-values). A collector's accumulation (so with little duplication) of 1070 First Day Covers spanning about a 25-year period from 1975-1990, all neatly arranged within a box. There is a great showing of corner blocks here, which must have been the focus of the collector. As such, the total value of stamps adds up quickly! While these were originally sold at a premium over the face value (and catalogue value would be significantly more). We have conservatively only counted the total face value of the stamps used. Total face value =	$1,386.15	$170.00
5531
167	Canada Covers - Postal Stationery #EN1, EN2. A matched set of the 1860 issued "Nesbitt" 5c red and 10c dark-brown envelopes, being both basic examples of Canada's first postal stationery series. An above average pair, embossed by the George F. Nesbitt & Company (New York) and printed on watermark "Ca/POD" paper. Many of these early issues have "stuck" flaps, being exposed to some moisture in the last 160+ years, these examples both have free and fully-gummed backflaps. Some very minor edge wear does not detract, but mentioned "for the record". No longer listed in Unitrade (since the issuance of the latest Webb catalogue). 2019 (8th Edition) Webb Catalogue =	$200.00	$80.00
3773
168	Canada Covers - Postal Stationery #EN2. The "Nesbitt" 10c dark-brown 1860 watermarked Ca/POD issue of Canadian first printed stationery envelope issue. A seldom-seen used example, sent from Waterville L.C. (Quebec) on July 9th 1863 to Portland, Maine USA. While with faults (including tears, creases), this is still an uncommon in-period, correct usage of this envelope, intended to pay the 10c cross-border rate. While the postal stationery has been removed from the Unitrade catalogue (since the newest Webb stationery catalogue has been issued), this EN2 envelope catalogued at $2100.00 in the 2018 Unitrade. 2019 (8th Edition) Webb Catalogue =	$950.00	$95.00
3634
169	Canada Covers - Private Cachet FDC Hoard / Accumulation. A bankers box, stuffed with albums, a shoebox and loose First Day Covers, 99% of which bear privately produced cachets. A grand total of 1072 covers, primarily from the 1950's to 1970's with some earlier / later sprinkled throughout. While heavily duplicated in a few spots (i.e. a late 1950's / early 1960's dealer stock of mostly H&E cachets), there are several notable sections including over 100 Fleetwood covers 1977-1980 and cachets from H&E, Kingswood, Cole, Rosecraft, E/M, SCS and Cachet Craft. Large lots of these private cachets are seldom offered. Estimate =	$250.00	$375.00
1786
170	Canada Covers - World War II. Patriotic and related cachet cover accumulation, in showbox. Approximately 325 covers, from a range of cachet makers and users. Noted about 100 from the McMillan "Fifth Anniversary" series, about 50 Purkis-related covers and a number of Rosenbaum cachets. Occasionally there is a TB label added to add some sparkle. A few are faulty, but most are in typical condition of covers from this era. A few items have duplication (up to 8 of a kind), but there is a wide diversity in this lot. Lots this size of WWII material are seldom seen, perfect for a collector or dealer. Estimate =	$300.00	$400.00
6396
171	Canada Precancels - 38 Different Cities & Towns. Useful selection of 506 different precancels (including 43 Edwards), all organized on five stocksheets. All identified by town or city and sorted by style. Noticed a good number in the $5.00-$20.00 range. The Standard Precancel Catalogue total value is over $1,450.00. The perfect starter lot or upgrading group for an existing collection. Estimate =	$350.00	$550.00
5440
172	Canada Revenues - Call it a holding, a hoard, or an accumulation. This lot fills a stationery sized box with thousands upon thousands of federal and provincial revenue stamps. Includes a nice (unnamed) Christmas folder showing a lit candle with 8 copies of the WWII War Savings certificate stamps. Noted envelopes and pages with excise, law, tobacco, War Tax and weights & measures. Noted a bunch of cancelled cheques in the 1930’s from Kincaid, Saskatchewan with stamps added for revenue purposes. The lot also includes a 2009 van Dam catalogue to help you sort it out. Estimate =	$150.00	$325.00
6519
173	Canadian Provinces - From fabulous to forgeries! All five provinces are represented here. The BC with an attractive mint forgery of the 10c on 3p value, New Brunswick includes #8, 9, 11 (x2) all mint, Newfoundland starts with a couple of nice early imperfs and after a 20-year gap there are better items scattered including 9 attractive mint stamps from the "Trail of the Cariboo" set. There are then five stamps from Nova Scotia (#8/13) and six from Prince Edward Island (#6/16). A good starter lot or perfect for cherry picking and then breaking up resale. 2024 Scott US$1007.00 =	$1,359.45	$160.00
6330
174	Canadian Provinces - NB, NS and PEI Sampler. Mint Hinged and used selection of stamps from: New Brunswick (#6-11, 6a); Nova Scotia (#8-13); and PEI (#6). Expect the odd fault in the mix but here's a good start to pre-Confederation philately. 2024 Scott US$504.00=	$680.40	$34.00
6351
175	Canadian Provinces - New Brunswick 7/11, Nova Scotia 9/10, PEI 5/16, Newfoundland 11A/248, J1/J1a. Two pages of pre-Confederation classics including both mint and used with some duplication. The unused New Brunswick stamps have no-gum (and have been counted as the lowest catalogue value). A few of the stamps have perforation issues and the mint are hinged. That being said, overall very fresh condition. As a small bonus, there is a proof single of #30 in the colour of issue (not counted in catalogue value). Total 2023 Scott US$1170.35 =	$1,579.97	$120.00
3811

Trimmed at bottom and with a few irregular perfs, otherwise sound. These first issues are often found with damaged or trimmed perfs due to the difficulty in separating the stamps from the sheet (the combination of rough perfs and soft paper were problematic). Fill the space in your collection now, upgrade later. 2024 Scott US$1,450.00 =	$1,957.50	$140.00
3587
209	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #2. Mint Original Gum Hinge Remnant example of the 1861 issue 3p blue Victoria, perf 9 x 9. Note a few irregular perfs and a horizontal crease, otherwise sound. These first issues are often found with damaged or trimmed perfs due to the difficulty in separating the stamps from the sheet (the combination of rough perfs and soft paper were problematic). A much nicer looking example than we usually see. A very rare pre-Confederaton Provincial issue. 2024 Scott US$2,500.00 =	$3,375.00	$325.00
3543
210	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #3. Lightly cancelled used example of the 1861 issue 6p yellow green Victoria, perf 9 x 9. Note trimmed perfs and a small thin at upper right. These first issues are often found with damaged or trimmed perfs due to the difficulty in separating the stamps from the sheet (the combination of rough perfs and soft paper were problematic).

3543
211	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #4, 5, 7-10, 11-16. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Original Gum Hinged selection of 10 different 1862 to 1872 period pence and cents issues.

6032
212	Canal Zone - Classic Canal "Kiloware"! 75 grams of circa 1910, all used, mostly on paper.

Easily a few hundred stamps in total, incredibly untouched after over 100 years! Estimate =	$130.00	$32.00
4261
213	Cape of Good Hope #2/62. Grouping on a stockpage of "Hope" triangles and "Symbols of the Colony" which include what appears to be 11 genuine examples, in 1d, 4d, 6d, and 1/- denominations with a range of margins. Expect some with the usual minor thinning often seen on these issues, but these stamps alone catalogue US$2545.00. This is followed by three-rows with about 60 used singles with revalues aplenty and cancel interested, but not much catalogue value. Lasty, there are a couple faked and a couple South African triangles are on the bottom row. A great lot for further research. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
3509
214	Cape of Good Hope #177. Socked on the Nose "on piece" Mafeking CDS used example of the 1900 issue "MAFEKING BESEIGED 2s" provisional surcharge on 1sh green British Bechuanaland issue (with original overprint on GB stamp). A great "in period" Boer War piece. 2023 Scott Classic US$650.00 =	$877.50	$140.00
3634
215	Cayman Islands #32-44 Plus Shades. Very Fine complete set of 13 (plus additional shades) of the 1912 to 1920 issue GeoV definitive set, all with CDS or partial CDS cancels. A pretty and comprehensive group! 2024 Scott US$738.50=	$996.98	$150.00
1496
216	Cayman Islands #44. Very Fine CDS used example of the 1918 issue 10sh green and red on green GeoV high value, watermark 2 (Crown and CA). 2024 Scott US$250.00 =	$337.50	$75.00

217	Cayman Islands #135/376. All select quality used 1953 to 1976 period QEII collection (plus a handful of earlier issues), 273 stamps and souvenir sheets in total, all housed in a top quality black page stock book. The material includes a good number of listed shades and varieties. 2024 Scott US$317.85 =	$429.10	$90.00
2951
218	Cayman Islands #251/521. Very Fine mint Never Hinged 1970 to 1984 period collection (plus a few earlier and some varieties) of 398 stamps and souvenir sheets, all neatly organized in a top-of-the-line stockbook. Probably all purchased as "new issues" and immediately placed in the stockbook, it appears to be complete for the period. 2024 Scott US$477.80 =	$645.03	$32.00
2271
219	Ceylon #3/411. Mixed used (a few earlies) and mint Hinged 1857 to 1967 period collection of 126 all different stamps and souvenir sheets, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stocksheets. Almost all complete sets from the 1930s up and a nearly complete run from 1935 up to 1967. 2024 Scott US$431.15 =	$582.05	$60.00
2712
220	Ceylon and Sri Lanka - Mounted collection of 500 used stamps, covering the period of 1855 - 1987. The collection starts with a bang, with a 2-margin copy of #1 (star watermark, imperf, blued paper), followed by a nice smattering of classic design issues, including GeoV up to 1R value and a 1935 Silver Jubilee set. Lots of postmark potential throughout and only light duplication with the condition overall appearing excellent. Penciled catalogue values from many years may put a smile on your face, as many have appreciated so much since done. Owner’s approximate 2023 Scott US$800.00 =	$1,080.00	$150.00
3795
221	China #920-923. VF mint Very Lightly Hinged complete set of four 1966 issue "1st Athletic Games of the New Emerging Nations" commemoratives. 2024 Scott US$320.00=	$432.00	$75.00
4224
222	China - Collector’s accumulation of material including a clutch of early republic issues, a couple of old collections of early China (including lots of overprints), some earlier PRC issues on stockcards and some sets from the 1970’s-1980’s. We even noted an example of the 1984 "Year of the Rat" complete booklet. There could be surprises lurking here for the knowledgeable collector. Estimate =	$130.00	$42.00
5719
223	China - The old, the new and not much in between. A significant accumulation that starts with a substantial holding of Republic issues, mostly used in glassine envelopes with overprints, multiples and cancels everywhere. This is followed by a bundle of album pages and stockpages with mint and used Republic and 1990’s or later PRC, with the occasional set going back to the early 1970s. The lot concludes with an old stockbook with Republic issues, including lots of earlier material. Most of this material was accumulated a generation ago and shows no signs that an expert eye has perused these. Estimate =	$300.00	$95.00
4389
224	China - PRC #1/1014 plus Northeast China and East China Liberation Areas. File folder with mounted collection of mint and used from the early days after the creation of Communist China, until just before the Cultural Revolution issues. Nice clean material, individually identified which is useful as the stamps were mounted by size and configuration rather than catalogue number. A good range with better individual items to $10.00 or sets to $50.00. The earlier issues for PRC and for the Northeast China Liberation areas are presumed to be reprints, and catalogued as such. 2023 Scott US$1272.20 =	$1,717.47	$90.00
2410
225	China - PRC #144/1863. The balance of a consignment. Includes mint sets and high value singles from 1974-1981, includes the "Monkey King" and "Guilin Landscapes" sets, all of which are very fine, mint Never Hinged which we removed from their original sale glassines. There are a few mint reprint blocks of the "gymnastics" issues (catalogue US$413.50), a page of used material is mostly from the 1960’s (including #627), a postally used "Terra Cotta Soldiers" high-value duo (sadly removed from their souvenir sheet) and a smattering of items that catalogue $2-$10 each. The used material alone catalogues US$269.05 and appear to be in good condition, with no obvious faults noted. Total 2023 Scott US$682.55 =	$921.44	$120.00
5719
226	China - PRC #661/680. Three-quarters of arguably the most important butterfly topical issue set in the world. These 15 denominations include the high values and are missing only #666, 668-670, 674. Beautiful stamps in lovely, fresh mint condition and although they are no gum (as issued), these are even more desirable as they have never been hinged. None of the usual toning or spots as often seen on stamps from this era. 2023 Scott US$541.00 =	$730.35	$130.00
4224
227	China - PRC #661-665, 676-680. The butterfly issue "first release" grouping representing the complete first half of the set, issued April 5th 1963 with all the low and high denominations. The second release (issue later, not included) provided the in-between values. Nice fresh appearance, mint and "as-issued" without gum (these have been hinged, mentioned "for the record"). 2023 Scott US$355.00 =	$479.25	$55.00
6213
228	China - PRC #767-781. Complete mint Never Hinged set of the Chrysanthemum issue of 1964. Post Office fresh colour, but with a few gum bends noted "for the record" and a fingerprint on #769, otherwise a beautiful appearing set. 2023 Scott US$625.00 =	$843.75	$150.00
6426
229	China - PRC #1557-1573. Complete set of "Tall Paintings" by Qi Baishi with 16 nature scenes featuring flowers, birds, animals and mushrooms. Complemented with the souvenir sheet with a "Hyacinth" view. All very fine mint,Never Hinged condition, still arranged on consignor’s original album pages. 2023 Scott US$370.50 =	$500.18	$140.00
6426
230	China - PRC #1749-1761. The "Twelve Beauties" from the "Dream of Red Mansions" issue. A complete set of 12 "beauties", plus the matching souvenir sheet from the issue that was released gradually between 1981-1982. All are in magnificent, mint Never Hinged condition. 2023 Scott US$275.50 =	$371.93	$95.00
6426
231	China - PRC #1904. Souvenir sheet of "beauties wearing flowers", featuring a painting by Zhou Feng from the Tang Dynasty. A lovely mint Never Hinged example from 1984, the last of the high-value souvenir sheets before PRC started increasing production quantities to meet collector demand. 2023 Scott US$210.00 =	$283.50	$65.00
5112
232	China - PRC - Several black stockpages with a seemingly random assortment of sets and singles, from the 1960’s-1980’s. All appear to be mint, Never Hinged and all have a very fresh appearance. Strength is in 1979-1982, with better sets with including cranes, horses, lanterns and kites (the only duplicated set). Total 2023 Scott US$968.90 =	$1,308.02	$220.00
6426
233	China - ROC #1355-1358. Complete mint Never Hinged "Emperors of China" set from 1962 in Post Office fresh condition. A very popular issue, with the most famous recognizable face being Genghis Khan. One of the key sets from Taiwan. 2023 Scott US$370.00 =	$499.50	$110.00
2776
234	Christmas Island #34/375. Very Fine and mint Never Hinged 1969 to 1995 period collection of 488 almost all different stamps, 17 souvenir sheets and one souvenir booklet. All housed on Hingeless printed "Seven Seas" album pages (plus a couple of Hagner pages of duplicate spares). The pages are in a single volume "Seven Seas" binder with matching slipcase. Appears to be complete for the period. 2024 Scott US$581.25 =	$784.69	$130.00
6205
235	Cyprus #2/808. A somewhat sparsely populated, but surprisingly valuable 32-page blue UniSafe stockbook with 360 mint and used stamps. Includes some better, such as an unused copy of #2 (plate 181, catalogue US$525.00), a number of QV/KEVII/KGV keyplates (including some cancel potential) and a used copy of the 1-pound QEII high value #182. Many mint sets, singles and souvenir sheets from the 1970’s-1980’s, which a quick check indicates that most are never hinged. Estimate =	$150.00	$50.00
2271
236	Cyprus #140/316. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Hinged 1937 to 1968 period collection of 176 all different stamps and souvenir sheets, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on six Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete GeoVI and QEII sets and a complete run from 1937 up to 1968. 2024 Scott US$818.85 =	$1,105.45	$110.00
3552
237	Dominica #94/205. All Fine to Very Fine mint Very Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1968 period collection of 100 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete sets from the GeoVI and QEII period and a nearly complete run from 1937 up to 1968. 2024 Scott US$262.75 =	$354.71	$75.00
3795
238	Estonia #1/153, B1/B49, C1/C18. Attractive inter-war collection on black stockpages of over 240 stamps and one souvenir sheet. Very complete, except the overprints on Russian issues, in mint, used (or both), perforated & imperf, including better values such as #107 and #123. Includes some very nice postally used "back of the book". Also included (but not counted in the catalogue value) is a 1947 Hanau displaced persons "Camp Post" souvenir sheet of 10 (from the 1947 Philatelic Exhibition) some private issues and some "dubious" overprints (not valued and offered as-is). Total 2023 Scott US$1060.20 =	$1,431.27	$180.00
3795
239	Estonia - Group of high-quality stamps, accompanied by a couple of dubious high-values (that will fill a space). This accumulation includes a number of souvenir sheets, including mint and used examples of the #147, #B39 Parnu and Tallinn issues (fewer than 50,000 of each ever produced). Noted 7 diff "Eesti Post" overprints on Russian issues and 1932 imperforate airmail semi-postals used. There is also a couple of mounted collections of early material, including some cancel potential and a bit of post-USSR material. Expect some duplication and some faults. The dubious material includes an "Eesti Post" overprint #17 mint (would catalogue $7,000) and a very attractive set of overprinted, imperforate airmail pairs #C4-C8 (would catalogue $1,015.00). An attractive well-above-average lot. Estimate =	$200.00	$150.00
5345
240	Fiji #114/235. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1967 period collection of 119 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete GeoVI and QEII sets and almost a complete run from 1937 up to 1967. 2024 Scott US$513.60 =	$693.36	$120.00
6537
241	Finland #6/746, B5/B171 and Karelia issues. An old-time "Stender" 2-post album with pages up to 1978 houses a very attractive collection with a mix of several hundred used and mint (hinged) stamps. Starts with some nice 19th century issues, including 3 with serpentine roulettes (usual mixed survival rate of the teeth). The collection has more specialized listings than Scott, but we have catalogued them as the basic items (so plenty of upside for the specialist). Includes a good run of semi-postals and finishes with a couple dozen overprinted Finnish issues used in the occupied Karelia area of Northwest Russia. A very clean collection. Total 2023 Scott US$777.10 =	$1,049.09	$170.00
6482
242	France and Colonies - Catch-all of various auction, bidboard and dealer purchases that were acquired for a "rainy day" that never came. France includes some nice material from the 1930’s-1940’s including two gutter pairs from the 1937 PEXIP show souvenir sheets (no gum), better semi-postals, some earlier material from the 19th century and complete booklets from the 1960’s-1980’s. From the Colonies, there is strength in St.Pierre & Miquelon and some notable Guadeloupe, Algeria, an intriguing mounted collection of French Guiana and a mixed group of mostly African and middle-east French Territories. For the record there is a group of four "OF Castellorizo" overprints that would have significant catalogue value if genuine (but they appear to be fakes). Estimate =	$160.00	$230.00
4475
243	France Offices in Egypt #1/74, B1. The "Port Said" issues, including overprints on France 1899 Peace and Commerce issue, a mix of mint and used stamps (with a few duplicates) and some later modified-design types. Good appearance (especially in the used), but the few mint items are heavily hinged. We don’t see this type of material often. 2023 Scott US$363.10 =	$490.19	$210.00
5055
244	Gambia #129/234. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1967 period collection of 111 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete GeoVI and QEII sets and a complete run from 1937 up to 1967. Great topicals, omnibus sets, overprints and more. 2024 Scott US$327.20 =	$441.72	$65.00
6292
245	German Democratic Republic #48/962, B15/B145. Borek springback binder with a fairly complete collection of DDR up to 1967 mounted on quadrilled pages. Mint, used and often both, with a fairly complete offering of singles and sets. Includes better earlier issues and good topical issues (animals, space, flowers, music etc). Despite the occasional use of black mounts, expect the mint stamps to be hinged. The ordering of the mounting was intended to be chronological, which only partially succeeded, so a bit of hunting and reorganizing is to be expected. Total 2023 Scott US$1024.15 =	$1,382.60	$75.00
5977
246	German Democratic Republic #82-84. 1951 Chairman Mao / Friendship with the People’s Republic of China fresh, complete set of three. Mint Never-Hinged, but the 50pf has a light diagonal gum bend, which does not detract from the appearance of this set (mentioned for the record). One of the most desirable sets from DDR, heavily sought after by collectors of China / PRC. 2023 Scott US$205.00 =	$276.75	$38.00
3634
247	German Democratic Republic #144a/146a, B21a. Trio of imperforate, used souvenir sheets. Includes a pair of Karl Marx and the Leipzig Stamp Exhibition semi-postal souvenir sheets. CTO, with full gum and some gum disturbance. Very fresh appearance, the key souvenir sheets from DDR issued in 1950 /1953. Total 2023 Scott US$510.00 =	$688.50	$60.00
6008
248	German Democratic Republic #144a/288a. Souvenir Sheets. Starting with a pair of mint Never-Hinged pair of 1953 Karl Marx souvenir sheets (#146a has a minor corner bend, mentioned for the record), followed by 5 different souvenir sheets from the same period, each of which was roughly mounted (the Engels and Schiller sheets has visible damage on the front). Some of the key imperforate DDR 1950’s souvenir sheets. Total 2023 Scott US$373.50 =	$504.23	$50.00
3634
249	Germany - A three-part lot, as received by the previous owner which includes...1) Lighthouse hingeless album pages complete of 1976-1982 with approximately 200 mint and used stamps and dozens of FRAMA labels (note, the later pages have colour images of the stamps printed on the page, look for a diagonal line on the image, which indicates there is no actual stamp there). 2) Four double-sided stockpages containing over 1000 used stamps. 3) Berlin Linder hingeless album pages 1955-1975 with about 125 stamps. 4) Two stockpages of Berlin issues (catalogue US$325.00) and a pair of envelopes with 200 different used 65 mint NH stamps respectively. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00
6236
250	Germany - Dealer’s stock from several years (decades) ago on several hundred older "102" cards in fragile boxes. Strength is in the first half of the 20th century but noticed a bit of German states and some postwar DDR and GDR. There are some desirable se-tenant multiples, semi-postals and airmail issues to be found with the duplication appearing to be fairly light. This stock was probably assembled in the late 1970’s and it looks like as it was about 80% written. The somewhat disorganized order of these sales cards makes is difficult to ascertain at first glance what is here, but expect some better items to be found thoughout. Overall condition appears good, but expect the mint items to be mostly Hinged. Estimate =	$160.00	$90.00
4982
251	Germany - DDR #10N1/934 plus semi-postals. Mounted mint collection covering 1948-1967, missing a couple of pages circa 1950-51, but otherwise very complete and clean. Most definitive sets are complete and there is lots of topical interest (Olympics, space etc). Includes some souvenir sheets and a fair coverage of the semi-postal issues. Not looked at since reunification, ignore the old pricing. The are few random used stamps that were not counted in the catalogue value. Total 2023 Scott US$967.10 =	$1,305.59	$95.00
6443
252	Germany, Post WWII and DDR - An intriguing, mounted collection of 1930’s-1940’s German material on "Neerlandia" quadrilled pages. The binder is likely seen it’s last days, but the pages are good. Includes a nice range of mostly used 1932 von Hindenburg issues including multiples of se-tenant values with different denominations, tabs, mostly from booklets. There is then a number of post-war mint and used issues (including American Military Government) and including overprints, a few souvenir sheets and "back of the book" issues. The lot concludes with DDR in three booklet panes (groups of 9) consisting of #188a, #188b and #227a (catalogues $684.00) but with a bit of edge adhesion, but at least six panes of each should be in decent condition. Ignore the pencilled notes about previous catalogue value as they were not relevant. Estimate =	$200.00	$220.00
5977
253	Gibraltar #102/212,152a. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1967 period collection of 108 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stocksheets. All complete GeoVI and QEII sets and a complete run from 1937 up to 1967 plus extra perf varieties. 2024 Scott US$463.20 =	$625.32	$85.00
2712
254	Gold Coast #112/160. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1954 period collection of 45 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on one Hagner brand stocksheet. Almost all complete GeoVI and QEII sets and a nearly complete run from 1937 up to 1954. 2024 Scott US$239.30 =	$323.06	$55.00
4291
255	Great Britain #1. Commemorative Folder. The famous 1840 issue Penny Black with a signed (Leon Norman Williams) and numbered (#500) "Certificate of Authenticity and Genuineness", enlarged photo and additional promotional hardcover folder (stained cover) from the Excelsior Collector's Guild Ltd. Used with black Maltese Cross cancel. Here's your chance to acquire a certified example of the world's first postage stamp. 2023 Scott Classic US$375.00 =	$506.25	$220.00
6052
256	Great Britain #1 Used Trio. Mixed condition used group of three 1940 issue Penny Blacks, the world's first stamps. Noted a couple with creases, some scuffing or margins cut-in. Unchecked for plate numbers. A great lot for plate reconstructors. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,125.00=	$1,518.75	$190.00
4475
257	Great Britain #1/1726. Collection that on first glance makes you appreciate that the collector did not see the worth in investing in an expensive album, but did have a good eye for detail on the stamps. An intriguing collection of earlier British material, starting with a nearly 4-margin Penny black and with a nice representation of classic Victorian-era issues. Includes better with individual catalogue values up to $400.00. Besides being very complete, there is lots of cancel potential, including more dated cancels than are normally seen. A random check of issues indicates that the items are generally properly identified on the pages. Edward VII issues are fairly complete up to the 5/-, with duplication selected for different shades (but catalogued as the cheapest). The GeoV Seahorses gallop up to the 10/- denomination and are followed by hundreds of GeoVI and Elizabethan era issues up to the mid-1990’s. Only catalogued to the end of GeoV, with visibly damaged items not counted. Owner’s 2024 Scott US$12,997.30 =	$17,546.36	$550.00
1837
258	Great Britain #1a. The Scott Classic and Stanley Gibbons listed intense black shade of the 1840 issue Penny Black, VF appearing but with a minor fault (tiny corner thin at lower right corner). Used with a light Maltese cancel in red. Clear to huge margins on all sides. Take a good look at the scan as the stamp is unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$600.00 =	$810.00	$220.00
6052
259	Great Britain #2,4. Trio of used 1840 and 1841 issue imperf "Tuppence" blue singles, consisting of: one x #2 (no white line at top or bottom); and two x #4 (white lines at top and bottom). Could be better shades or plates. All valued as the basic types. Small faults noted. 2024 Scott US$1,955.00=	$2,639.25	$95.00
6136
260	Great Britain #8/45, 173a, 174a. An all used selection of an almost all different group of earlies, all Victorias except for two GeoV (De la Rue) Seahorses. The complete listing consists of: #8; #11 (x 2); #26; #29 (plate 19); #30 (plates 13, 14); #33 (plates 91, 117, 119, 157, 160, 200); #40; #43 (plate 12); #46 (plate 6); #173a; and #174a. A useful mix! 2024 Scott US$1,779.00=	$2,401.65	$110.00
5977
261	Great Britain #22/200. An incomplete run of 15 pages from an old Windsor album with about 220 used stamps from 1855-1925. A better than average collection remnant, that was collected by Gibbons numbers (unchecked by us). When there are duplicates, it is typically because of different printings, shades or plate numbers. Condition a bit mixed (as is often the case), but there are many strikingly attractive stamps and many "socked on the nose" cancels. Includes a number of individual stamps with catalogue values of over $50.00 each. Strength is in QV and KEVII era. Catalogued as the cheapest version of each stamp. Total 2023 Scott US$9770.00 =	$13,189.50	$290.00
5977
262	Great Britain #28, 46, 52, 53, 57, 59b, 60, 73. Sound and Fine to Very Fine used selection of eight different 1856 to 1876 period Victorian issues. Decent overall colour, nice range of postmarks. 2024 Scott US$3,025.00=	$4,083.75	$85.00
5977
263	Great Britain #33. Calling all plating hunters or sheet re-constructionists. Includes attempts at identifying and organizing one of the great QV-era puzzles from at least 4 different collectors (a quick check indicates that they generally had them correct) PLUS a couple of glassine envelopes with at least another 100 unchecked stamps. Appear to be totally unchecked for cancels, but expect some duplication. We conservatively estimate 350 stamps and have conservatively catalogued them at the Scott minimum value of $3.00 each. Total 2023 Scott US$1050.00 =	$1,417.50	$190.00
6356
264	Great Britain #33. Plated Penny Reds selection of 152 stamps, neatly laid out on pages and identified by the consignor (to the best of his ability), plus and additional pages of 47 Penny Reds which are unplated. While many have small faults (as they were selected for plating), the previous owner states that the fine or better stamps alone catalogue US$1409.00 ($1902.15 CDN). Estimate =	$140.00	$120.00
6356
265	Great Britain #54/229. Seven random album pages with 95 used QV-GeoV stamps. Individually identified (including plate numbers). Includes a number of items with catalogue values up to $400.00 each. The first stamp of the lot has a nice bit of selvage printing and there are some nice cancels to be found throughout. While this grouping skips KEVII, it has a nice offering of GeoV, including a number of different (and duplicated) Seahorses, up to the 10/-. A bit of mixed condition to be expected, but generally an attractive lot. Total 2023 Scott US$4779.00 =	$6,457.65	$300.00
5977
266	Great Britain #67, 70, 73. Trio of QV issues from the mid-1870’s. Cleanly used, with light to moderate clean cancels. Usual centering, strong watermarks and better than average perforations. 2024 Scott US$850.00 =	$1,147.50	$50.00
6014
267	Great Britain #98-107. Complete used set of the 1883-1884 QV definitive set, most with dated CDS cancels. The 3d has trimmed perforations and is not counted. Expect the usual minor faults such as small the thins or pulled perfs. 2023 Scott US$1582.00 =	$2,135.70	$46.00
3732
268	Great Britain - Bankers Box containing the balance of a consignment. There is a bit of almost everything 20th century to be found here, being an array of album pages, stockbooks, "102" cards, presentation packs and First Day Covers. Strength in GeoV and QEII "Wilding" definitives, but also noted a large sorted stock of used QEII Machins, a bit of Channel Islands material and some "Cinderella" items. Sure to be some finds for the patient sorter. Estimate =	$140.00	$50.00
4996
269	Great Britain - GeoV to QEII First Day Cover Selection. Uncacheted and addressed group of forty different "home made" First Day covers, 1935 to 1960s period issues. Both the 1935 GeoV Silver Jubilee and 1936 EdwardVIII covers are only franked with single 1½d stamps and while rare, are not valued in the total. Only complete sets as per Stanley Gibbons catalogue have been catalogued, and only 10 of the covers issued up to 1960 have been included in the catalogue value total. 2017 Stanley Gibbons Concise £442.00 =	$750.00	$34.00
6128
270	Great Britain - Modern used selection of 192 different used stamps from the 2016-2023 period, including 38 "pound" values. Latest catalogue values have risen considerably, illustrating the scarcity of finding recent used issues. 2024 Scott US$352.00 =	$475.20	$280.00
5983
271	Great Britain - Small boxed packed with British GPO cachet First Day Covers from 1966-2001. A total of 531 covers, featuring a nice range of both definitive and commemorative stamps from the period, including many complete sets and several high-values. The stamps alone would have a significant catalogue value. Conservatively estimate at less than 25c per item. Estimate =	$120.00	$170.00
6128
272	Great Britain - Three volume balance of a consignment. Includes Stanley Gibbons pages 1971-1998 with a near complete run of commemorative issues in black mounts with about ¼ being mint (face value about £40.00) and the remainder used which look like to have first day cancels. The second binder includes stocksheets with an assortment of used GeoV up to 2006 (very complete in the QEII commemoratives), with several more recent souvenir sheets and includes 5 "seahorses" up to 10/- (one of the 5/- has a nice perfin). The final binder contains a mounted collection of used Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Isle of Man up to about 2006, including some back of the book (many of these actually appear to be postal usages!). Estimate =	$140.00	$200.00
6001
273	Great Britain and Netherlands Accumlations - Mixed mint and used duplicated selections/accumulations in three volumes, consisting of; black stock book containing an all mint duplicated stock of over 893 Great Britain stamps, Victorias to QEII (mostly 1950s to 1970s) period; fat red stock book containing a modern used duplicated selection of over 550 Netherlands semi-postals; and a duplicated used accumulation of several hundred Great Britain QEII "Wildings" on stock pages. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
5977
274	Hong Kong #154/504. GeoVI / QEII definitives (only) accumulation inside a black 32 page "Elephant" brand stockbook with acetate interleaves. Mostly used, with moderate to heavy duplication but including some nice cancels. The value is in the relatively few mint (Hinged) stamps that include #160 (block), 166A (x2), 167 (x3), 197 (x2), 198 (x3) and #217. The GeoVI features values up to $10.00 and QEII up to $50.00. Besides the significant catalogue in the mint stamps, we believe that there could be other items hiding in the bulk. Estimate =	$300.00	$190.00
5900
275	Hong Kong - A quartet of stockpages with classic used Hong Kong, including overprints and revalues with great cancel potential. The lot includes a starter collection of 540 (duplicated) stamps up to 1973, a small handful of dealer’s cards, a booklet, souvenir sheets and a couple mint multiples from the 1990’s.The lot finishes with about 90 copies of the last "mailbox" souvenir sheet, just before control reverted to China. Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00
5900
276	Hong Kong - QV to GeoV cancel, perfin and private overprint (firm chops) lot. Includes lots of "Treaty Port" cancels, including different types. We noted Amoy, Canton, Macau, Tientsin, Punyu, Hankow, Swatow, Foochowfoo and even a German Seapost cancel alongside lots of Shanghai/Shanghae (including a striking cancel on a "Stamp Duty" revenue). Includes 3 perfins and 5 private security overprints (firm chops). A total of 120 stamps, with individual catalogue values up to $25.00 each. Some great eye-candy here, or a chance to start a new interesting research group (or add to an existing one). Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
4475
277	Hong Kong and Treaty Ports - Old mounted collection (from 3 different sources) that starts slowly with a "Three King" (Edward, GeoV, GeoVI) offering, the best being KEVII issues identified and lightly used. This slow start transitions quickly with several interesting pages of Treaty Port cancels, often with several examples including Amoy, Canton, Foochowfoo, Hankow, Macao, Swatow, Shangai/Shanghae with most being SON (socked on the nose) full value cancels. The lot continues with another grouping of pages for local issues for treaty ports and a bit of a mix of mint and used with duplication. In viewing the duplication, you get the sense that the collector was moving towards a more specialized collection. Finally, the group concludes with stamps from Amoy, Chefoo, Kewkiang, Foochow, Shanghai, with various printings and back of the book issues included. Estimate =	$250.00	$270.00
4475
278	Hungary #9/3957 plus lots of Back of the Book. Seven small boxes (about the size of a small shoebox) from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that created with the intention of dealing but was never viewed by customers. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 4500x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes. Well over 15,000 stamps, with the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition and a quick peek indicates that few catalogue more than $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues up to 2005, there is over one full box of "back of the book", such as semi-postals, airmail, postage due and various "occupation" issues. Lots of nice cancels noted in the earlier material. At estimate, this lot doesn’t even cover the cost of the glassine envelopes! Estimate =	$250.00	$55.00
6300
279	India #203-206, 207-222. Two complete 1948-1949 issue sets, including the famous Gandhi set of four and long pictorial set of sixteen. All VF mint, Very Lightly Hinged. 2024 Scott US$906.20 =	$1,223.37	$200.00
3732
280	India and States - Binder filled with album pages and stockpages (from numerous sources) stuffed with a messy accumulation of material QV to post-independence, offered as received. We noted several items with postmark interest, some postal history, Indian states, overprints, officials and revenue stamps. Likely a few hidden gems lurking throughout. Estimate =	$140.00	$120.00
4858
281	Indonesia - Assorted collections, auction lots and dealer purchases, most in the "as purchased" form. There is a wide offering of Republic-era issues, with and without additional overprinting, a lightly populated Minkus album with pages to 1995 (but few stamps past 1972), newer issues including the flora/fauna issues of 1994/1996 (including joint issue booklet/souvenir sheets with Australia), a bit of Japanese-occupation, a presentation booklet from the 1952 UPU congress in Bruxelles, (which has to be scarce, but needs some flattening). The most notable is a set of eight different 1949 UPU souvenir sheets (perf, imperf, overprinted) all mint never-hinged. The lot represents material from a dozen sources with some duplication and lots of value throughout. Estimate =	$180.00	$75.00
4466
282	Iran #870A/870F. The 60th birthday of Reza Shaw Pahlavi. Selection of 11 pieces including mint and used partial sheetlets, both perforated and imperforate. Includes #870E & #870F mint perforated, #870A-D imperf mint sheets (Scott gives a premium of 35% over the basic catalogue value of $45.00 per sheet). #870A & #870C unused imperf on piece. And finally, half imperf sheetlets on piece (no premium for imperf). The mint appears to be never hinged, but appear to have been pinned to something in their past. Still scarce material that is seldom seen. 2023 Scott US$494.50 =	$667.58	$130.00
5055
283	Ireland - Selection of 488 different used stamps from the 1953-2022 period, being ONLY stamps that catalogue over US$1.00 each. Very comprehensive for this period, with none of the lower values. 2024 Scott US$1103.00 =	$1,489.05	$190.00
5983
284	Italy #518, B29, J26. Sound and Fine to Very Fine trio of better individual regular and "Back of the Book" issues, consisting of a Very Fine mint Never Hinged example of the 1949 "Centenary of the Roman Republic" 100 lire brown commemorative, a VF used example of the 1926 issue 5 lire + 2.50 lire "People's Gate" semi-postal and a mint Hinged example of the 1890 issue 20c on 1c postage due. Any of these three of these stamps will be welcome additions to any Italian collection! 2024 Scott US$975.00 =	$1,316.25	$75.00
5038
285	Italy and Colonies - An accumulation from many sources, bought from local dealers but never processed. Included are sections of album pages, sales cards, "102" cards and glassines of loose stamps. A very disorganized offering here, making it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. The strength appears to be in the first half of the 20th century, but there are certainly some earlier "classics" with lots of beautiful cancels noted. We also noted some "back of the book" (including overprints), Eritrea and San Marino on album pages to round this lot out. Expect to spend some time sorting this out. Estimate =	$150.00	$180.00
5984
286	Japan #55/2910 plus Back of the Book, Prefecture and Ryukyus. Two small boxes (about the size of a small shoe box) from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that never made it's way to be sold or viewed by potential customers. Mostly used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from 1 to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 1300x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 4,000 stamps, with the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition and a quick peek indicates that few catalogue more that $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues from 1930-2005, there is some 19th century material, with lots of cancel potential. Note: The second box is a bit out of order, as it likely had a spill at one time. Easily worth the estimate, as that price would just cover the cost of the glassines! Estimate =	$130.00	$170.00
6255
287	Korea #18, 20B, 25, 26, 27, 19a, 21e. Mint Original Gum Hinge Remnant selection of eight different 1900 to 1901 period issues, in both the perf 11 and perf 10 types. Expect the odd short perf or gum bend but a fresher offering than we usually see. 2023 Scott Classic US$329.75 =	$445.16	$32.00
6087
288	Korea and North Korea - Combination lot which included Korea #3/2154 plus a bit of "back of the book" and North Korea #390/2616. One small box from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that readied for sale, but was never viewed by customers. Mostly used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 25 copies in each glassine. Our conservative guess is that there are over 500x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes with over 2,000 stamps, including the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. Overall, condition is good and a quick peek indicates that few catalogue more than $5.00 each. Mostly from the 1950’s to 2005. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
6397
289	Latin America - A long-overlooked corner of the world that is finally finally getting its due. This banker’s box contains mostly "one-off" material, often old auction lots, or parts of collections. There are some multi-country sections (including 4 APS sales booklets that were written up and then never sent in). There is a binder of Uruguay and a mounted collection of Bolivia, but after that no particular strength, but a quick flip found material from Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, Columbia, Paraguay, Chile, Venezuela and Haiti. Not all of the material is organized, including the centre section of the box which is a pile of glassines, "102" cards, souvenir sheets and three presentation folders. Estimate =	$140.00	$220.00
5495
290	Latin America - First bankers box of vest-pocket dealer’s stock (arranged within 4 smaller boxes), with stamps from Brazil, Nicaragua, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Ecuador. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 2600x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, containing well over 7,000 stamps. The stamps that are here appear to be in decent condition. As expected, most of the material is more common, however there is a still a good range of material, starting with the 19th century (with many nice cancel) and running in batches until the early 2000’s, complemented with a goodly range of back of the book issues. Estimate =	$250.00	$80.00
4686
291	Latin America - Second bankers box of vest-pocket dealer’s stock, with stamps from Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Panama, Guatemala and Haiti. This bankers box is filled with three and a half fully packed homemade boxes. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 2300x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 6,000 stamps. The stamps appear to be in very decent condition. As expected, most of the material is more common, however there is a good range of material, starting with the 19th century (many nice cancels) and much "front of the book" material up to about 2005 followed by lots of "back of the book" issues. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
4686
292	Latvia #B87-B91. Complete Mint NH imperforate set of the 1932 semi-postal issue, with surtax to aid the Latvian Home Guard. A matched set of singles, pairs and blocks for issue stamp in the set. Post Office fresh and attractive. 2023 Scott US$315.00 =	$425.25	$75.00
3634
293	Latvia - Wonderful accumulation of material from many sources, almost all as originally purchased by the consignor over a period of year (decades) and then not touched. The best of the pre-annexation issues are "back of the book", particularly the airmail semi-postal issues, including imperforates. Noted three overprinted imperforate airmails with "Latvija-Afrika" 1933 overprints. The regular issues are no slouch, with there being a mounted collection, lots of loose glassines and 102 cards and a dealer’s stock on manilla stock sheets that includes a goodly offering of post-USSR issues. For some reason there are 20 cards with #439 for "Latvia at the Turn of Epochs"(!). An attractive lot to sort, break apart and sell off what you don’t need. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
5345
294	Liechtenstein #1/1444. Regular issue collection on computer generated pages up to 2009, with a mix of mint and used with many better singles, sets and the occasional souvenir sheet. Includes individual sets or singles with individual catalogue value up to US$175.00. A quick check indicates that the mint are hinged (the first set has almost no gum) and overall condition looks above average. The only downside to this collection is that the previous owner mounted the stamps using photo corners, so remounting is strongly recommended. Each stamp identified by Scott, some with catalogue values from many years ago. We have re-catalogued the group, so take the previous notated prices as older catalogue values. 2023 Scott US$1811.30 =	$2,445.26	$140.00
2951
295	Liechtenstein #62/258, C1-C6. Selection of 57 "key-value" mint and used issues from the 1920’s-1950’s. We noted #62-67 (used), #68-69 (mint), #74-79 (mint), #104 (mint), #105 (used - lovely Vaduz cancel), #108 (used), #111-113 (attached to a large piece), #116-129 (complete pictorial set used, with an extra copy of #121), #247-258 (farming set, used) and finally the complete mint 1930 airmail set. All mint stamps are hinged, with appearance and overall condition being excellent. 2023 Scott US$1359.55 =	$1,835.39	$160.00
5241
296	Liechtenstein #B4/B24, C1/C37, J1/J21, O4/O59. Terrific Back of the Book collection, on computer-generated pages, the companion to the previous lot. The strongest sections are the semi-postal issues (includes B4-10 and the postal museum souvenir sheet #B14) and airmails which include the 1931 Zeppelin and Hindenburg / Graf Zeppelin issues of 1936 (all nicely used). There is also a bit of postage due and Official issues. We have not checked each of the stamps, as the previous owner had mounted them with photo corner, but overall appearance is excellent. 2023 Scott US$1307.30 =	$1,764.86	$210.00
5241
297	Lithuania #1/322, B1/B53, C1/C87, CB1-CB4. Classic-era collection on black pages consisting of 370 stamps, starting with the local post-WWI printings and with decent coverage of issues, including mint, used, perforated, imperforate and, three souvenir sheets. Lots of worthwhile "back of the book" noted. Condition appears to be well above average, with better items including #120-122 postally used and #CB1-CB4 to name a couple (but there are many better items throughout). 2023 Scott US$1018.30 =	$1,374.71	$280.00
4487
298	Lithuania #30/53. Coat of Arms issue. A mint never-hinged group of seven imperforate pairs and a corner block of 4, all with margin inscriptions. There is a later vertical pair of 30sk buff that is imperforate between (this with a significant amount of gum damage and not counted in the catalogue value). 2023 Scott US$900.00 =	$1,215.00	$110.00
3634
299	Lithuania - Terrific old-time holding meets "newer" holding. The interwar years are well represented, with mint and used, including souvenir sheets. We noted the 1920 Legislature, 1932 Orphans sets and some decent "back of the book" coverage. Lots of nice cancels, some duplication as this collector focused heavily on buying over sorting and inevitably bought items that he already owned. The before-mentioned covers the "old-time", but this offering also includes a decent coverage from 1991, with a dealer’s stock on manilla stockpages and various envelopes of mint and (mostly) used post-USSR issues. Lots of good potential here. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
3634
300	Malaya Peninsula - Brunei, Sarawak, Labuan, North Borneo and Straits Settlements. A series of mounted collections, stockpages and dealer’s sales cards/glassines with a few hundred mint and used stamps, from the Malayan peninsula and islands. Most are QV to early QEII, with the best being Brunei, noting "river scene" series, including the 1922 Exhibition overprints and the Sarawak which includes a couple of sets and high values. Amongst the loose material, is some nice Federated States, a GeoV used $25.00 Straits Settlements high-value (alas missing a corner), and a mint set of the North Borneo BMA overprinted set to $5.00. Lots of nice, readable cancels amongst the used stamps. This lot also includes two bundles of 1960’s-1970’s used packet stock, including lots of Singapore. Estimate =	$140.00	$100.00
4389
301	Manchukuo #1/164, C3-C4. Tidy mounted collection with a mix of mint and used issues, which includes the first set mint (the hinges appear to be VERY peelable, which should leave very light gum disturbance) and the 1934 definitive complete used set. There are some "plus-value" items such as stamps cancelled on piece, an older dealer’s sales sheet, a few pairs and a very small number of items which are represented by both a mint and a used example. Very complete offering in attractive fresh condition. 2023 Scott US$1,222.40 =	$1,650.24	$575.00
4224
302	Marshall Islands #239/524a. Group of 1939-1945 Fleetwood WWII Events prepared collections. This former US, Japanese and German colony islands group had a reunion of sorts, when in 1989 it issued a number of stamps commemorating WWII events (including both triumphs and tragedies). Fleetwood supported this issue by releasing a comprehensive hardbound series of coffee-table sized books for each year of WWII, with each issue in mint blocks or mint panes and single stamp First Day Covers. These attractive books are extensively notated with lesser-seen photos. There is one for each year of WWII, with the exception of the 1943 (oddly missing, so five of the six volumes are here). The stamps and covers are in perfect condition, album pages with some minor warping. The original cost of this set would have been astronomical. Stamps alone have a total 2023 Scott US$884.00 =	$1,193.40	$46.00
6466
303	Marshall Islands #239/939. Combined 2-part lot. The first part is a collection of mint never hinged issues from about 1990-2009 with sets, sheetlets and a couple of booklets, all on manila stockpages, with some duplication. Huge topical interest including fish, plants, birds, historical figures, Christmas and airplanes (to name a few). The second part is Volume 1 of the WWII 50th anniversary set produced by Fleetwood with stamp issued in blocks of 4, commemorating events of 1939-1940. While not catalogued, the amount of "face value" is substantial. Conservatively valued for the total face value alone. Total face value US$346.32 =	$467.53	$95.00
3501
304	Mauritius #211/320. All Fine to Very Fine mint Very Lightly Hinged 1938 to 1967 period collection of 117 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete sets from the GeoVI and QEII period and a complete run from 1938 up to 1967. 2024 Scott US$378.65 =	$511.18	$75.00
5389
305	Montserrat #16/470. The accumulation of consignor purchased auction lots, collections, accumulations or dealer stock which were set aside (some for many years / decades), but never fully sorted. That being said, the collector did have a good eye for attractive material so there are lots of interesting items throughout. While the GeoV and earlier is sparse, the limited items that do fall into that era have some nice cancels. There are some good sets including the two GeoVI sets, the 1953 QEII set, 1965 plant definitives and the 1970 "Birds" set. Noted some of the common design issues and a bit more modern material up to about 1982. The mint is a mix of hinged and unhinged. As this was accumulated from several sources, expect some minor duplication. Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00
4466
306	Montserrat #89/188. All Fine to Very Fine mint Very Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1966 period collection of 89 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete sets from the GeoVI and QEII period and almost a complete run from 1937 up to 1966. 2024 Scott US$267.45 =	$361.06	$48.00
3266
307	Nauru #58/436. Archivally fresh, Very Fine and mint Never Hinged 1966 to 1995 period collection of 460 all different stamps and souvenir sheets. All housed on Hingeless printed "Seven Seas" album pages. The pages are in a single volume "Seven Seas" binder with matching slipcase (retail value of the album alone is over $150.00). All originally purchased as "new issues" and appears to be complete for the period. 2024 Scott US$403.20 =	$544.32	$150.00
4472
308	Netherlands #1/1041, B1/B716, C1/C16, J1/J106, O1/O58. Remarkably complete (mostly) used collection in three White Ace albums. Excellent coverage of classic issues right through to the end of 1999, with equally fabulous back of the book, including semi-postals, airmails, postage dues and officials. Includes better early issues, many sets are only missing the very top value and includes individual items with catalogue values up to US$200.00 each. We noted a selection of syncopated perfs, better airmails and an excellent selection of semi-postals (the later ones including many complete used booklets or souvenir sheets). The relatively small number of mint includes most of the 1940 overprint set (including the high values) and some of the later charity issues. Overall condition is excellent. The stamps are mounted with care. A wonderful "foot in the door" to a new collecting area, or strong addition to any Netherlands collection. 2024 Scott US$4046.30 =	$5,462.51	$525.00
3543
309	Netherlands #7/1159, B1/B739. Lovely mostly "modern" collection of Netherlands stamps, in a pair of mismatched Davo albums. Volume 1 has a padded vinyl cover filled with standard pages and is sparsely populated up to about 1940, but then gets steadily stronger to 1960 and is very complete all the way to the end of 2003. Volume 2 binder has a "fabric" cover, with pages from the start of the 21st century with a "back of the book" section (only semi-postals noted) The earlier period is a mix of mint and used, but the later periods are almost exclusively mint stamps. The pages become hingeless in the mid-1980’s and the stamps from that point onward all appear to be never hinged. To supplement regular sets and singles there are a number of booklets and mini-sheets / souvenir sheets. Good value throughout, besides the albums, there are over 1000 stamps and the modern Euro-era stamps have a usable face value of €91.00. There are even some blank pages for you to intersperse your own treasures here. Estimate =	$250.00	$42.00
5885
310	Netherlands #1163/1401 plus Semi-Postals. Complete 8-year run of Euro-denominated hardbound year sets 2004-2011. Includes the complete run of issues, with singles, sets, souvenir sheets (including the higher value sheet issued each year) and semi-postals. The albums are a more compact size than most countries and include good writeups and lovely photographs in support of these issues. Most of the stamps have been put into their respective mount within the books. We did note that one stamp from the 2004 set is missing (for the record) but otherwise all appear to be complete and in excellent condition. Conservatively value at the issue price / usable postage (excluding the charitable premium). Total face value €391.19 =	$583.79	$42.00
3205
311	Netherlands and Colonies - Dutch treat! Starts with a basic collection of over 1200 mint and used issues in an album with pages up to 1990, followed by at least a couple thousand stamps, mounted on pages or stockcards, including Dutch Antilles, Curacao, Suriname (some nice semi-postals) and a bit from New Guinea. The used material definitely has some cancel potential. Purchased by the consignor over a number of years and left unchecked. Estimate =	$130.00	$65.00
5295
312	Netherlands Colonies - A pair of very lightly populated standard Davo albums with pages for Dutch Indies, Antilles, Curacao, Suriname and West Guinea with pages up to 1994 (for the colonies still issuing stamps by then). The binders are mismatched, one is of the older "fabric" style the other in vinyl, but both with matching slipcases and overall are in good shape. The value here is in the albums, but also included is an older 12-page stockbook, filled with stamps that might help you out in filling these pages (most are from the Indies and includes some early Indonesian material). Estimate =	$130.00	$75.00
5984
313	Netherlands plus Antilles and Indies #5/1269 plus Back of the Book. Two small packed boxes (about the size of small shoeboxes), plus some overflow material from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that was created with the idea of selling, but never viewed by customers. Mostly used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from 1 to about 50 copies in each glassine. A conservative guess is that there are 1500x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 5,000 stamps and the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition and a quick peek indicates that few catalogue more that $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues up to 2005, there are lots of semi-postals and a few postage dues. At estimate, this lot doesn’t even cover the cost of the glassine envelopes! Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6466
314	New Zealand #51/1179. Quality basic starter collection of used issues from the "Second Sideface" issue up to the early 1990’s. Includes some nice pictorials (a few with nice cancels), Edward VII and GeoV definitives up to 1 shilling, an 1/2d Auckland issue, good representation of the 1935 and 1940 issues and then very complete afterwards. Noted a few used souvenir sheets and there a bit of Health issue semi-postals to round-out the lot. Overall condition looks good for the period, with several hundred stamps in total. Estimate =	$130.00	$42.00
5841
315	New Zealand #B1/B126. Health Stamps 1929-1986 mint collection being a highly-complete representation of material for the time period. While most of the earlier issued are Lightly Hinged, as the material gets newer it transitions into mostly NH stamps. Nice clean material, neatly laid out on stockpages. Owner's Scott catalogue US$469.60 =	$633.95	$80.00
6205
316	New Zealand #B1-8, C1-8. Small, but mighty, mint early semi-postal and airmail issues. Includes both "Smiling Boys" and the "Trans-Tasman" 7d airmail issue. Lovely fresh appearance, hinged (most lightly-hinged). 2023 Scott US$468.85 =	$632.95	$150.00
5742
317	New Zealand #B52a/B120a. Wholesale "Health" issue semi-postal souvenir sheets hoard. Group of 105 mint, mostly never hinged souvenir sheets issued between 1957 and 1984, with between 1-12 of a type (very few are missing). These have been stored away flat for years, so there are relatively few faults. Great thematics such as sports (tennis, cricket, basketball, rugby), birds and animals (cats, dogs, horses). A very popular group of issues, which in these quantities allow you to fill in holes and sell the balance to recover some of your purchase price. 2023 Scott US$745.45 =	$1,006.36	$75.00
5841
318	New Zealand and Pacific Islands - A pair of over-filled homemade boxes, from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock. Three quarters of the material is from New Zealand (starting with some Victorian-era material and concluding with some useful "back of the book" material). We also noted some representation from Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Penrhyn, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine, with our conservative guess being that there are 1400x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 3,500 stamps and including the occasional small-sized souvenir sheet. The stamps appear to be in decent condition, but to be expected, most of the material is more common. That being said, there are sure to be some hidden gems throughout. A good mix of stamps with material goes that up to the early 2000’s. Estimate =	$130.00	$75.00
5841
319	Nigeria #50/172. All Fine to Very Fine mint Very Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1965 period collection of 137 all different stamps and souvenir sheets, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. Almost all complete sets from the GeoVI and QEII period and a nearly complete run from 1937 up to 1965. 2024 Scott US$262.75 =	$327.31	$55.00
6008
320	Pakistan #1/152, O1-O26. All Fine to Very Fine mint Very Lightly Hinged 1947 to 1961 period collection of 176 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on five Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete sets and a nearly complete run from the first issues of 1947 up to 1961, with Officials and several additional Scott listed varieties also included. 2024 Scott US$673.70=	$909.50	$240.00
6157
321	Pakistan Bahawalpur #1/29, O1/O28. Lightly duplicated mint (mostly Never Hinged) and postally used selection of 1947 to 1949 issues from this short-lived Punjabi independent Indian state that was eventually acceded to Pakistan. A great start to the material from this storied South Asian region. 2023 Scott US$446.90 =	$603.32	$42.00
6276
322	Poland #16/3820 plus Back of the Book. Four small boxes (about the size of a small shoebox) from an aspiring vest-pocket dealer’s stock that never was viewed by customers. Mostly used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. We estimate that there are at least 2500 x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 7,000 stamps including the occasional small-sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition and quick peek indicates that few catalogue more than $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues from 1920-2005, the "back of the book" includes semi-postal, airmail, postage due, official and General Government. This collector was transitioning to being a dealer, but never made the leap. The material has potential for unidentified shades, varieties and printings not listed by Scott. At this estimate, the lot doesn’t even cover the cost of the glassine envelopes! Estimate =	$150.00	$95.00
5841
323	Portugal and Colonies - A pair of small homemade boxes (about the size of small shoebox each), from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock. About half of the material is Portuguese, the balance being from a number of colonies including Angola, Azores, Macau, Mozambique, Congo, Sao Tome, Portuguese India, etc. There is a mix of mint and used stamps up to the early 2000’s, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope (anywhere from 1 to about 50 copies in each glassine). Our conservative guess is that there are 1200x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 2,000 stamps. The stamps appear to be in decent condition and include some 19th century material with potential (including nice cancels). Estimate =	$130.00	$65.00
6466
324	Portugal and Colonies - Pile of Portugal purporting philatelic potential. Several collections, stocks, and dealer purchases as assembled by the consignor over a number of years (then put aside and not processed). We noted a partial set of the 1st Independence issue (including the high value), the 1945 souvenir sheet and some modern booklets. Many colonies represented here (to various extents), including Mozambique, Guinea, Macau, Portuguese India, Cape Verde, Madeira, Angola and Azores. Truly unpicked offering, which should prove rewarding for the purchaser. Estimate =	$180.00	$220.00
4776
325	Rhodesia #1/25. A group of 13 duplicated mint Hinged stamps from the first set issued by the British South Africa Company in 1892, between the 1/2 penny and 4 shillings value. A few small faults to be expected, but generally a solid Fine to Very Fine mixture with fresh colours. Includes a Never Hinged example of the four shilling (#13). Note both Scott and Stanley Gibbons numbering. Owner's Scott 2021 Scott US$583.00 =	$787.05	$80.00
4475
326	Rhodesia #17. Fresh and Fine mint no gum 1890-1894 issue £2 Coat of Arms high value. Scarce! 2023 Scott Classic US$500.00 =	$675.00	$55.00
3634
327	Rhodesia #18. Fine to Very Fine lightly CDS cancelled used example of the 1890-1894 issue £5 yellow green Coat of Arms high value. Some minor toning at left noted for the record. 2023 Scott Classic US$500.00=	$675.00	$85.00
6136
328	Rhodesia #26/91. A selection of 26 duplicated mint Hinged British South Africa Company stamps from the "Arms" issues of 1896-97 (Die 1, Die II and as re-designed) and 1898-1909 (including overprints). A useful grouping, including some shade variations. Scott numbers provided by owner. Owner's 2021 Scott: US$1,141.00 =	$1,540.35	$180.00
5658
329	Rhodesia #30, 32, 34-39, 67, 68, 70, 71 SPECIMENS. An even dozen 1890 to 1908 issue "Coat of Arms" types, all with either "SPECIMEN" overprints or perfins. The Scott catalogue value as mint stamps is US$964.00. Unlisted as Specimens in Scott. Estimate =	$325.00	$140.00
6128
330	Rhodesia - Southern Rhodesia #1/108; Rhodesia #200-222. All Fine to Very Fine used and mint Hinged selection of 142 different 1924 to 1964 GeoV, GeoVI and early QEII period issues from Southern Rhodesia, mostly in complete sets, plus a 1965 issue mint set from Rhodesia. All identified and neatly laid out on three Hagner stock sheets. A great basis for expansion. 2024 Scott US$985.05 =	$1,329.82	$95.00
5658
331	Rhodesia and Nyasaland #141/190, J1-J4. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1954 to 1963 period collection of 55 all different stamps, including postage dues, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on two Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete QEII sets and a complete run from 1954 up to 1963. 2024 Scott US$282.30 =	$381.11	$130.00
6286
332	Romania #68/4885 plus semi postals and airmail. Three packed small boxes (about the size of a small shoe-box), plus some overflow from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that created with the aspiration to be a dealer, but was never viewed by customers. Mostly used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 2300x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 7,000 stamps and the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition, few several that catalogue more that $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues up to 2005, there are lots of semi-postals and airmail issues. The estimated price would not cover the cost of the supplies alone! Estimate =	$150.00	$30.00
6466
333	Russia #21/6821 plus some Back of the Book. Four small boxes (about the size of a small shoebox) from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that was readied for sale, but never viewed by customers. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope with anywhere from 1 to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 2500x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 8,000 stamps and the occasional small sized souvenir sheet. The stamps that are here are in decent condition and a quick peek indicates that few catalogue more than $5.00 each. Besides a good run of regular issues up to 2005, there are lots of semi-postals and airmail issues. At this estimate, this price doesn’t even cover the cost of the glassine envelopes! Estimate =	$170.00	$230.00
1407
334	Russia #1026/3571. Scott Specialty album containing issues from the 1946-1968 period, mounted on almost two hundred pages with over three thousand stamps plus some souvenir sheets in the mix. The stamps and sheets are mainly CTO. The quantity is a bit thinner in the earlier years but the collection is almost complete from 1956. A useful, fairly comprehensive and attractive group. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
3762
335	Russia - Bundle of Bolshevik bliss! A very eclectic lot of auction lots, album pages and stockcards. Mostly 20th century, with lots of pre-WWII issues, including perforated/imperforate, overprints, some promising back of the book, partial sheets and souvenir sheets (often space topical). We noted #845-849 (mint never hinged, with usual gum bends, catalogue US$250.00), wholesale lot of Greek democracy issue #3500 and many sets, blocks, cancels. Even saw some Ukraine and West Ukraine issues that you will need to judge for yourself. Finishes with a pocket-sized presentation booklet from the 1957 UPU conference in Ottawa. Estimate =	$140.00	$260.00
5345
336	Saint Helena #79/81 varieties. Four KGV "Badge of the Colony" mint pairs, each with one "normal" stamp, and one with an SG listed print variety. Each of the three denominations has the "broken mainmast" variety, and there is an additional pair of the 1-1/2d with a "torn flag" variety. While not listed in Scott catalogue, these are embraced by Gibbons and listed as SG 97a, 98a, 99a and 99b. Each stamp has a Light Hinge and we noted (for the record) that the 1d has very acidic gum (brown, patterned) and a corner crease. Total 2018 Stanley Gibbons £370.00 =	$610.00	$95.00
4721
337	Saint Helena - Trio of GeoV "Badge of the Colony" mint pairs, each with one "normal" stamp and one with the Stanely Gibbons listed "broken mainmast" variety. Listed as Gibbons #SG98a, 100a, 104a. Each stamp is Very Lightly Hinged, with the 6d with a corner crease, not visible from the front (mentioned for the record). Very fresh and a nice addition to any collection. 2018 Stanley Gibbons £560.00 = $924.00	$924.00	$130.00
4721
338	Saint Kitts Nevis #76/187. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1967 period collection of 109 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete GeoVI and QEII sets and a nearly complete run from 1937 up to 1967. Great topicals, long pictorial sets, omnibus issues and more. 2024 Scott US$333.75 =	$450.56	$55.00
3266
339	Saint Lucia #91/225. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1935 to 1967 period collection of 135 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete GeoV, GeoVI and QEII sets and a complete run from 1935 up to 1967. Great topicals, omnibus sets, overprints and more. 2024 Scott US$306.10 =	$413.24	$80.00
5389
340	Saudi Arabia #159/191, C1-C6, J25-27, O1-O6. A spectacular offering of mint Never Hinged issues from the key 1934-1950 time-period, as pulled from a postal administration presentation booklet. Includes parts of the King Abdul issue (includes a duplicate of #172), the "Old City Walls", "Government Railway" and the first airmail and official sets, plus three nice postage dues. All fresh but some might have a touch of gum disturbance here or there, so there were no never-hinged premiums added. Includes the original Post Office booklet, which is a bit worse for wear but worth keeping "for the record". 2023 Scott US$1303.75 =	$1,760.06	$160.00
3552
341	Somali Coast #64/308 plus BOB. Popular French African colony (pre-Djibouti),represented in a comprehensive collection of mint and used on trimmed Minkus album pages. Includes topicals, long pictorial sets and some better "back of the book". Mint is hinged and although there may be the occasional minor fault, the overall condition is excellent. Each item/set was meticulously catalogued in 2014 at $1350.00, but a quick check of some of the better items indicates that some catalogue values have dropped 10-20% since then. We have conservatively estimated the 2023 Scott catalogue value. Estimated 2023 Scott US$1080.00 =	$1,458.99	$210.00
5241
342	Somaliland #77-143. All Fine to Very Fine mint Hinged selection of 67 different 1935 to 1960 GeoV, GeoVI and early QEII period stamps, all in complete sets. All identified and neatly laid out on two Hagner stock sheets. Includes omnibus issues, overprints and long pictorial sets. 2024 Scott US$360.10 =	$486.14	$80.00
4466
343	South Africa #1/313, B1-B4, C1-C6. All Fine to Very Fine used and mint Hinged selection of 279 almost all different 1910 to 1966 GeoV, GeoVI and early QEII period issues from All identified and neatly laid out on four Hagner stock sheets. A good starter group and a great basis for expansion. 2024 Scott US$706.95=	$954.38	$60.00
3509
344	South Africa / New Republic #1/55. An interesting selection of this "colony" as before it became part of South Africa, it became part of Transvaal, and in the 1880’s this "New Republic" issued 65 stamps. This grouping of 13 different mint examples constitutes 20% of the total issues of New Republic and includes denominations up to 10/-. Generally nice clean appearance, all are hinged, with the occasional bit of offset (as often seen). We noted that #2 has a pinhole, and #21 has a minor thin but otherwise, condition is well-above average for this seldom-seen material. Includes #1-3, 20-22, 41b, 43-4, 47, 49, 54-5. Total 2023 Scott US$427.50 =	$577.13	$120.00
6114
345	Southwest Africa #108/297, C1-C4. All Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged selection of 143 different 1931 to 1964 GeoV, GeoVI and early QEII period issues, almost all in complete sets. All identified and neatly laid out on three Hagner stock sheets. Great topicals with all the se-tenant pairs intact. 2024 Scott US$496.45 =	$670.21	$120.00
6268
346	Swaziland #24/122, J3a-J6. All Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged selection of 116 different 1937 to 1966 GeoVI and early QEII period issues, all in complete sets. All neatly laid out on three Hagner stock sheets. Great topicals! 2024 Scott US$419.65 =	$566.53	$170.00
6286
347	Switzerland #43/1255, B18/B696. One full and one half-sized homemade boxes from a vest-pocket dealer’s stock that was created with the intention of "sales", but never viewed by customers. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope. Anywhere from one to about 50 copies in each glassine. Conservative guess is that there are 900x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, containing well over 5,000 stamps. The stamps that are here appear to be in decent condition. As expected, most of the material is more common, but there is a good selection of Helvetia issues, including a few better with many of the issues up to about 1920 having beautiful cancellations. Besides a good run of regular issues up to 2005, there are significant numbers of semi-postals, airmail, postage due and various "official" issues. Estimate =	$180.00	$90.00
5841
348	Switzerland #B2/B145. Pair of stockpages with 79 lovely used "Pro-Juventute" semi-postals, most in partial sets, often with lovely cancels. Lots from the "Shields/Coat of Arms" issues. Great way to start a collection, to fill in holes, or to upgrade condition of these popular pre-1945 issues. Total 2023 Scott US$334.25 =	$451.24	$34.00
6001
349	Switzerland #J1/J67, S1-S13a. Used postage due and "Franchise Stamps" on album pages, with room for basic issues. Starts with a beautiful set of the first set of "blue dues" and is then "hit or miss" into the 1930’s. Unchecked for listed printings for inverted frames or colour shades, so there could be some "finds" waiting to be found. This collector had bought another page of stamps, but never got around to mounting them (included as well). Overall condition looks good. 2023 Scott US$516.25 =	$696.13	$42.00
2951
350	Switzerland #J1/J67a. Artful homemade album pages are the home of this excellent collection of used Swiss postage dues. Organized by Zumstein, this collection starts out a bit slow in the "blue dues", and continues to gain strength, finishing with the red dues as singles and used blocks. Nicely organized with spaces for regular and inverted frames, colours/shades, revalues and paper / gum types. Not a great match for Scott listings, but that should only please the specialist. Basic 2023 Scott US$678.55 =	$916.04	$55.00
2951
351	Switzerland - Banker’s box accumulation. The box is half-filled with collections that were started, but never completed (probably 10 of them), including pages knifed from some very old-time albums. Mostly 20th century, up to about 1990, with more used than mint. We noted a few copies of #100 and some decent issues from the 1920s-1930s. The second half of the box is a shoebox absolutely packed with two dealer’s stocks of mostly used material and four 3-ring dealer "counter" binders with mostly cheaper material. Overall, there are thousands of stamps here. Who knows what is hiding here? You don’t often see Swiss lots like this. Estimate =	$200.00	$170.00
5841
352	Tanganyika and Nyasaland Protectorate - A couple dozen Keyplates, mostly GeoV making a very striking group of used copies. The Tanganyika includes 8 copies of #39, and 7 copies each of #40/42. The Nyasaland includes the 2/- KGV (lovely SON "Fort Johnston" CDS cancel) and a 10/- GeoVI example. A couple might be revenue usages, but overall lovely stamps from these popular former British African colonies. 2023 Scott US$363.00 =	$490.05	$120.00
3773
353	Thailand #98/2068, B36, C7/13. A pair of Hagner stockpages containing 83 mint, mostly Lightly Hinged, stamps with one block and the rest being all-different singles. The group starts with some earlier issues including overprints, then moves a bit randomly to the end of the 20th century with a number of better singles (often the high value for a set) and concludes with a very small amount of worthwhile "back of the book". Post Office fresh appearance. 2023 Scott US$582.65 =	$786.58	$40.00
5984
354	Tonga #1/111. Four-page mounted collection with 74 mostly mint stamps, including some King George I issues plus the 1892, 1897 and 1953 sets. Very fresh appearance. Expect the mint stamps to be fairly heavily hinged (not unusual for early Tongan material). 2023 Scott US$752.90 =	$1,016.42	$140.00
6136
355	Tonga #73/181, C1/C33, CO7-CO11. Fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged 1942 to 1967 period collection of 144 all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on six Hagner brand stock sheets. All complete regular, airmail and official airmail sets. A nearly complete run from 1942 up to 1967. Great topicals, long pictorial sets, embossed die-cuts, and more. 2024 Scott US$212.25 =	$286.54	$55.00
269
356	Tonga #1217a. Modern rarity used example of the 20s surcharge on the 1989 4s Pteriois Volitans stamp. While unlisted in the Scott catalogue, this variety is listed in Gibbons as #1217a, unpriced as used, but valued at £400.00 as mint. A bit of online searching shows that 1200 were printed and used strictly for mail (info included). The few examples we could find (none for sale) were also used, so we are applying the same catalogue value for used. A great chance to acquire a modern Tongan rarity. 2023 Gibbons £400.00 =	$685.60	$50.00
6008
357	Tonga - Selection of 53 different postally used 1972-1994 issues, including high-values (noted #809, catalogue US$65.00). Seldom seen material, especially postally used. 2024 Scott US$256.00 =	$480.60	$75.00
3333
358	United Nations - New York. Meaty Three Volume Collection. Mint and used 1951 to 1999 period collection, all mounted on Minkus album pages and housed in three high quality blue Lighthouse brand 3-ring binders with matching slipcases (over $100.00 retail for the binders only). The earlier portion of the collection often has parallel mint (including the #38 souvenir sheet) and used stamps as well as souvenir sheets. In the two later volumes we find complete "Prestige" booklets, Flag sheets, postal stationery and First Day covers. With a bit of reorganization this lot is a great opportunity for expansion and completion. Estimate =	$250.00	$180.00
4586
359	United Nations - The balance of a spectacular UN collection. Lots of worthwhile and unusual materail here, both in stamps and supplies. Includes three Lighthouse brand binders with Vario pages containing ; Designer Autographs on their First Day Covers, Geneva First Day Covers 1971-1983 and an assortment of meters and slogan cancels. Also included are two old exhibitis, "Save Nubian Monuments" (complate) and "An overview of collecting UN" (partial) as well as 4-volumes of flag stamps on Postal Commemorative Society FDC (1981-1984). Estimate =	$180.00	$55.00
4261
360	USA #11/3446. Three volume "Sentinel" album collection stuffed with mostly used stamps up to year 2000. There is moderate coverage through the 1870s-1880s, with denominations up to 15c. The Columbian issue runs to 10c, noted a $1 Perry, a complete Pan-Am set, Trans-Mississippi to 8c and then very strong through the Washington/Franklin issues onwards. There might also be some potential interest for precancel and perfin collectors amongst the early 20th century material. The only stretch where there is any mint is from about 1940 to 1960 with mostly 3c-4c plate blocks, but did see a complete set of the Famous Americans. Where this collection surprisingly shines is in the 1990’s with postally used (in-period) sheetlets and souvenir sheets that includes the Columbus and Trans-Mississippi re-issues and the Celebration of the Century sheets (among many others). Also noted many of the higher denomination "Express" stamps, but no real "back of the book". The only frustrating part of this collection is that the album has coloured pages, and at times you have to take a second look to figure out if you are looking at a stamp or a picture. Keep this in mind when viewing the images of this lot. Well worth the conservative estimate given. Estimate =	$300.00	$110.00
6550
361	USA #30P3. Superb quality and brilliantly fresh imperforate plate proof on india paper in the brown colour of issue of the 1861 printing of the 5c "Jefferson", type II. Massive margins on all sides. A real classic proof "gem". 2021 Scott US Specialized US$1,250.00 =	$1,687.50	$150.00
5112
362	USA - Annual year sets covering issues 1975/1989, with some duplication. All in their original envelopes (some of which are a bit aged, but the overall condition of the stamps is excellent). Many of the stamps (and the occasional piece of stationery) are still in their original packs. Most are the commemorative sets, but includes the 1983, 1984, and 1987 definitive issues. Also noted the 1982 bird sheet, a few loose issue and a pair of $9.35 Eagle franking space shuttle "Challenger" sent covers from 1983 in presentation folders. Conservatively valued for the usable postage only. Total face value US$149.27 =	$201.51	$150.00
5746
363	USA - File box with the balance of a consignment. A bit of a dog’s breakfast, with a mix of both common and better items. Noted a card with mint copies of the 8c Columbus and the 10c Trans-Mississippi, "102" cards with some nicer early cork cancels, some nice looking coils and some private Express service labels (we are presuming that these are mostly reproductions). Includes album pages, some 1970’s year sets and the usual bits and pieces that a collector sets aside because there is no obvious place for them to go. Estimate =	$120.00	$95.00
5917
364	Virgin Islands #29/761. Grouping of three accumulations and a few dealer cards, starting with an assortment of nice used from "three different kings" including a spectacular pair of the 5/- KEVII on piece with Tortola CDS cancels (#37, catalogue $150.00). There is a mounted mint collection covering a dozen years starting in 1963 (142 stamps here) and Scott pages covering a number of issues from 1990-1992 including the souvenir sheets that accompanied most issues (the catalogue value adds up quickly here). Good to start a collection, or to boost an existing one. Estimate =	$140.00	$190.00
4466
365	Worldwide - A 3-part offering, being the balance of the consignment. The first part consists of several stockcards with stamps of Aland, Belgium, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Italy , Luxembourg, Netherlands, South Georgia and Sweden with a combined catalogue value of over US$765.00. The second part is a high-value offering of Switzerland, with the 1922 used semi-postal set #B21-23 and the 1945 PAX issue #300-305 used (not the 5fr is faulty and not counted in the total catalogue value of US$625.00). The third part a selection of 34 better Iceland, mint and used and including #78 (used), #150 (used), #109, 115, 118, 182, 183, 184, 203-205, 207-208, 208Ac and 208Bd mint lightly-hinged (combined catalogue value US$520.00). Owners total 2022 Scott US$1910.00 =	$2,578.50	$140.00
6274
366	Worldwide - Album lot. Starts with three stockbooks (Lighthouse brand, 1x 32 page, 2x 48 page) of mostly used Mexico from the 19th and early 20th centuries including some "back of the book" and revenues. Noted Japan in a 32-page Filex stockbook and an assortment of New Zealand and Tokelau (mostly used from the last 50 years) in a 48-page King stockbook. There is a France Minkus album with pages up to 1981 (and then supplemented with computer generated pages up to 2010), with hundreds of mostly used stamps. Finally there is a gilt-edge Strand Gibbons worldwide album circa 1920 with hundreds of stamps from around the world (strongest in Europe). Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
6486
367	Worldwide - An ever-popular U-Haul box packed with an assortment of wayward albums, pages, stockcards and baggies of dealer material that has nowhere else to go. Starts with a "Standard" Harris album with "G-J" countries (thousands of stamps here), a smaller volume that has "T" countries, a binder of manila stockpages with Europe and another binder with Canada. Noted a collection for "World Refugee Year", a selection of Japan and some Scandinavia. After all this, almost every remaining space is filled with a series of bags with "desk sweepings" from almost literally "everywhere". Great value for the patient hunter. Estimate =	$150.00	$200.00
5824
368	Worldwide - Asian Accumulation. Grouping of miscellaneous collections, dealer’s stock, bidboard and auction lots as accumulated by a collector over a number of years. Noted lots from the Koreas, a good mix of Japan (including some souvenir sheets), some interesting China (pre-Revolution, with the usual litany of overprints), PRC (CTO stamps from the 1950’s and a nice run of 1987-1995 mint souvenir sheets and sets - including #2180) and Taiwan. Scattered throughout and in no particular order are some Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, Vietnam/IndoChina, and Manchukuo. Use the photos to guide you on this one. The catalogue value adds up quickly on this type of material. Estimate =	$250.00	$230.00
4923
369	Worldwide - Banker’s box full of several thousand "102" cards, with a collector’s duplicates. Expect that most are lower value items, from at least 50 different countries. Noted Great Britain, Germany, Australia, France, Hungary, Denmark and Japan among many others. Primarily used, with a bit of mint mixed throughout. The original cost of the cards would have been at least a couple hundred dollars. A nice lot for those looking for a winter project. Estimate =	$160.00	$90.00
5939
370	Worldwide - Bankers box, filled with "Ziplock" bags of worldwide on-paper "kiloware". Over 12lbs of philatelic fun, seemingly just thrown into baggies as received (or found) over a number of years. While there does not seem to be any rhyme or reason to the mixture, we did note that these do seem to contain both "old" and "new" material with stamps from the last decade, but also stamps that date back to the 1950's. A good sort and soak ahead for the intrepid collector. Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00
163
371	Worldwide - Bewildering box of bits and pieces. The end of a consignment, from one of our customers with perhaps the most diverse collecting interests (note: we aren’t starting a contest here). This customer had a good eye for buying interesting items, but had little interest in organizing his purchases afterwards. This interesting array included envelopes stuffed with stamps, "102" cards, packets (whose contents do not match the description on the outside), Scott International binder with an incomplete run of 1940’s pages, a couple very old worldwide collections, a few single country collections (including Ceylon, Crete, Greece, British Guiana) and an assortment of loose items (assortment doesn’t do justice to how varied this offering is). A rough look indicates lots of potential, in need of a good sort by a patient collector. Estimate =	$200.00	$210.00
3732
372	Worldwide - Bit of everything in this box of 18 volumes. Includes country specific offerings from Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines, France (1960’s town cancel lot), Hungary, modern Caribbean (e.g. Antigua/Barbuda), plus several albums or little stockbooks of worldwide (with many older, including some "oddball" material). Be prepared to spend several hours to go through this lot, as there are thousands of stamps here. Estimate =	$120.00	$48.00
6478
373	Worldwide - Choice offering of 52 different QEII mint stamps, with each stamp having a catalogue value of at least US$5.00. Mostly Lightly-Hinged, but with the occasional NH item. Take a close look at the scans to appreciate the value and scope of the lot. 2024 Scott US$550.00 =	$742.50	$42.00
1315
374	Worldwide - Choice offering of 66 different better "modern" used stamps, with each stamp having a catalogue value of US$5.00 to US$65.00. Neatly laid out and identified to be easily examined. Take a good look at the scan to appreciate the value held in this compact selection. 2024 Scott US$863.00 =	$1,165.05	$130.00
5719
375	Worldwide - Cinderellas and Seals by the sheet! Filling a small box, being mostly US but with a bit of Canada and a few other countries represented. Noted lots of TB, Easter Seal and Boys Town, but also noted some smaller charities and religious groups represented. The majority are in complete sheets or large blocks and most were issued between the 1930’s and 1990’s. Several hundred complete sheets, which are in individual page protectors and are overall in good condition. Expect a moderate amount of duplication. Colourful and fitting for the season, seldom offered in quantity. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
5817
376	Worldwide - Consignment balance in 13 albums, binders and stockbooks. Strength in Canada, but also noted some USA, Great Britain Regionals, South Africa and a huge amount material that is from worldwide collections and stocks (even saw some potential from Hong Kong and other British Colonies). Where there was a void in the end of the box, we were able to pop in a couple little stockbooks (in addition to the 13 albums). The material comes from a collector that couldn’t invest much in his stamps, but he had an eye for interesting and better material when the opportunity arose. As such, this is a better than usual offering of this type. Estimate =	$150.00	$95.00
6486
377	Worldwide - End of the line for several collecting lines that ended up in this U-Haul box ready for your hunting pleasure. Starts with a red "102" card dealer’s box, packed with French colonies material (a quick look indicates that it is mostly cheaper material, but there may be some hidden gems). A second red box is the next up, half-filled with country-sorted material and the other half with several hundred lightly used "102" cards. There is a box of 1950’s-1980s used France sorted into envelopes and a well picked 1911 "Senfs" album that might still hold the occasional surprise. There is an assortment of mostly used "floral" topicals, some 1920’s Germany, a Unitrade FDC album with about 100 modern BC post cards and a couple Taiwan "endangered mammal" presentation booklets. Last, but not least, is a group of mint New Zealand health sheetlets (most never hinged, a couple lightly hinged or minor gum disturbance) and 6 Australia complete booklets, including 3/6 GeoVI, 60c, 60c on 50c QEII and three "Famous Australians". Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
5574
378	Worldwide - Everything under the sun overfilling two U-Haul boxes. Includes albums, stockbooks, pages, stocksheets, remnants of auction lots, dealers stock, single country groups (noted Ireland and Iraq), envelopes and stocksheets packed with souvenir sheets, envelopes of used stamps (strength in Norway and Russia), presentation sets. Lots of topical potential and cancel potential trhroughout. There are thousands upon thousands of stamps here. A perfect lot for the intrepid collector looking for a sorting challenge. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6478
379	Worldwide - Fantastic Feline Fraternity! Cat themed stamps including singles, sets, souvenir sheets, imperfs and "Specimens". Mostly domesticated, but a few wild ones are lurking, with many different countries represented. Some are on black stockpages, others in dealer cards or loose in file folders, with lots of mint, never hinged and some CTO (cancelled to order). Most are from the second half of the 20th century. To keep things tidy, this lot comes in a "mahogany" wooden hinged box from the Bombay Company in the motif of an old leather-bound book. These wooden boxes were sold in the early 1990’s and currently resell for over $80.00 online! Estimate =	$150.00	$160.00
6545
380	Worldwide - Middle East. Using a broad interpretation of where this region starts and finishes, this is an accumulation of random purchases that the consignor assembled over a number of years (decades). This material is not often seen locally and there is definitely the potential for hidden specialized items for the prudent collector. Includes a mounted collection of Afghanistan, several bits of Egypt (including some souvenir sheets) / UAR / Palestine (some Gaza cancels and multiples of the 1958 UN Human rights issue), Aden, lots of Iran (from classics, the Shah’s 1950 birthday, and some officials, up to sheet stock of post-Revolution issues) and some 1980’s Oman. There is also some Yemen, a bit of Lebanon (1949 UPU souvenir sheet and a modern presentation folder) and what lot from this part of the world would be complete without some Abu Dhabi, Fujeria, Dubai, etc, with colourful topical sheetlets. A much better than average group of material and overall condition looks decent. Estimate =	$200.00	$200.00
4741
381	Worldwide - Mixed "grab box" of worldwide material including country collections, envelopes, pages of souvenir sheets, a couple of boxes of "102" cards, some covers, a presentation booklet, random album pages, old auction lots and several manilla stockpages with stationery cut squares. The kind of lot that looks like it’s filled with common material, but may have still hold surprises. Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00
4466
382	Worldwide - Premium offering of 69 different better mint stamps, from early issues to the 1940's with each stamp having a catalogue value of US$5.00 to US$120.00. Mostly hinged, with each stamp neatly laid out and identified for easy examination. 2024 Scott US$999.00 =	$1,348.65	$130.00
6353
383	Worldwide - Scandinavia and Colonies Smorgasbord from a consignment. A little bit from almost everywhere including... 1) Iceland: including a 98 stamp mint collection (catalogued $237.00 in 2009), 1986 year set and a handful of new issues circa 2007. 2) Greenland: Stockcard of mint and used (cat $170.05) and a glassine full of 2007-2008 new issues including souvenir sheets. 3) Finland: 2001-2002 new issues in glassine. 4) Faroe Islands: 2007 new issues. 5) Sweden: A few used officials (Includes #16a) and semi-postal issues. 6) Denmark: 2001 year set and a "Top of the World" souvenir sheet pack (2008, 3/3, with stamps from 8 countries). The lot finalizes with Danish West Indies on two cards, in usual mixed condition (these were catalogued in 2014 at around $400.00). Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
1315
384	Worldwide - Six red dealer boxes filled with 102 cards, from every corner of the world. Some of it well organized, some of it needing your sorting skills. Includes mint, used, sets and singles with some duplicate material and a wide-array of topical interest. Most items are identified by country, Scott # and catalogue value. Didn’t see many items over $5.00 each, but this makes for cheap, winter fun. The retail cost of the boxes and the "102" cards alone as supplies would exceed $300.00. Estimate =	$160.00	$180.00
4472
385	Worldwide - The "end of the line" for this consignment which ended up filling a U-haul box. Includes old auction lots, stockpages, stockbooks, albums, dealer cards and loose stamps in envelopes which all contribute to this packed box. Most of the items are a scattering of almost everything from across the Globe, but didn’t see much Canada, USA or Great Britain. This is from the holding of a local collector who bought anything that appealed to him, so you never know what will be in the next handful. Something that adds to the mystery is that he often tucked purchases into cards or envelopes that had previously been used and didn’t update the information on them, so you have to sort through these carefully with an attentive philatelic eye. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
269
386	Worldwide - Three densely packed U-Haul boxes each with at least 15 binders, albums, stockbooks and the remaining spaces filled with old stockpages or loose album pages. The stockbooks are generally clean and in nice condition with lots of life left in them. Besides the many world-wide collections or holdings, we noted material from the Middle East, Europe (lots of Germany and France), British Commonwealth (including the Caribbean and Great Britain), Argentina, and a touch of Canada, United States and Africa. There are small bits and pieces from Asia and Australasia too. The material is going to be mostly used and consists of thousands and thousands of stamps, from the 1800’s up to the early 2000’s. Estimate =	$360.00	$280.00
4922
387	Worldwide - Two file-card boxes laden with several hundred black 2-pocket dealer selection cards. Includes thousands of mostly common and mostly used stamps from over 50 countries, plus a couple dozen glassines with country-sorted material. Almost all from the 20th century, this is a chance for the worldwide collector to fill in some spaces, or to share with your local stamp club. The black stockcards are mostly in near-new condition and would retail as supplies alone for over $100.00. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
6539
388	Worldwide / South Asia - Group of Bhutan to Vietnam with bits of Cambodia, Ceylon, Indonesia, Laos, Malayan States, Mongolia, Pakistan and Singapore filling four home-made dealer boxes which fills a bankers box. There is a mix of mint and used stamps, sorted and identified by Scott number with each number getting its own glassine envelope (with anywhere from 1 to about 50 copies in each glassine). Our conservative guess is that there are 2600x #5 sized (6" x 3.5") glassine envelopes, with well over 5,000 stamps. The stamps appear to be in decent condition with a good range of material, up to about 2005 followed by lots of back of the book issues. Could be some surprises lurking. Estimate =	$180.00	$110.00
6255
389	Worldwide Covers - A globe-trotting selection of 214 covers and postcards including many better items from seemingly every corner of the earth, with notable Greece, France, Switzerland, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Netherlands, Israel, Persia and "South America". Each item is individually sleeved and priced by a Western Canada dealer, but the prices (in our opinion) are slightly on the "optimistic" side. The total retail value comes out at over $3500.00, but view the scans to get a better idea of the price point. A nice lot for the show / internet dealer to break apart or postal historian to have some fun sorting. Estimate =	$250.00	$160.00
5979
390	Worldwide Postcards - A postcard hoard, packed in a bankers box. Everything from classic era (pre-1920) to modern with greetings, linen and lots of tourist chromes from around the world. Overall strength in USA, Canada and Great Britain, but many other countries represented with a mix of both used and unused. While there is moslty inexpensive material here, there are still lots of $3-$5 cards to be found. Kept intact as received from the consignor. About 2000 cards in total, so lots of good sorting ahead. Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00
6150
391	Worldwide Postcards - Christmas-themed selection of 282 postcards, mostly USA and Canada, used between 1910-1930. Featuring colourful, snowy themes, including poinsettias, trees, Santa, holly, snowy landscapes, bells, toys, children and birds. Decent condition, most are handwritten and although some were sent through the mail (potential for better cancels), many were sent "under cover" within an envelope to the recipient. All neatly arranged within a 3-ring binder that includes empty pages that could probably hold double the cards found here. Estimate =	$140.00	$170.00
5055
392	Worldwide Postcards - Dealer’s box with overwhelmingly American postcards 1907-1965 with two major themes. The first is a grouping of 300 mostly different religious themes (e.g. churches, statues, stained glass, etc). The second is a group of 85 postcards with "verses" (e.g. poems, phrases, sayings), these are mostly from the 1910-1930 period. There are some real photo postcard (RPPC), but the majority are printed cards, up to the linen and chrome era. A mix of unused, written but sent under cover and a relatively small number are postally used. Estimate =	$100.00	$15.00
2955

A nice range of cards from vintage pre-1920 classic material, right up to "chromes". Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00

6150

Christmas dominates this dealer’s stock with almost 500 mostly different, with every subtheme that goes along with the winter holiday (e.g. snow, caroling, poinsettia, Santa, gifts, etc). The Easter themed cards from the same before-mentioned era are complete with bells, bunnies and floral themes (this group with an understandably more religious focus). About half of the postcards here are individually sleeved. Estimate =	$140.00	$170.00
5055
397	Worldwide Supplies - Bankers box filled with an array used philatelic supplies, just waiting to be put back into use. Lot includes (in no particular order)....1) Unisafe padded FDC album. 2) Four partial packages of "Hema" brand corner mounts (a desirable brand for cover collectors). 3) Micronta brand illuminated microscope (seems to be brand-new, working). 4) Three partial package of hinges. 5) UV-Lamp (newer brand), working. 6) "London" brand 16-page stockbook, black pages, like new. 7) Over four dozen partially used packages of mounts (clear and black, in a wide array of sizes). 8) G&K brand padded album with 2-line clear pages (for covers). 9) A couple dozen stockpages of various makes. 10) Lighthouse brand 3-row stockbook. 10) Two unopened (or full) packages of 100 clear heavy-weight page protectors. 11) A variety of small items including watermark trays, perforation gauges, a loupe and some tongs.

6434
398	Worldwide Supplies - Complete set of 2022 Scott International stamp catalogues, all in used condition. A bit more "used" than your regular set, with some loose pages in the Australian States and the early Canada section having been removed completely, but still present in page protectors (you can see the areas of interest of the collector by the book wear). That being said, a very usable working set of catalogues. There have been no major price changes between the 2022 and 2024 catalogues. As such, this set is still extremely useful for valuing most material and the numbers don't really change. New, these 12 volumes would retail for well over $1,200.00. The Scott catalogue numbering system is the most universally recognized stamp numbering system used today. Estimate =	$300.00	$260.00
5241
399	Worldwide Supplies - SIGNOSCOPE WATERMARK DETECTOR. In lightly used condition, this compact portable unit is simple and works quickly. Simply place the stamp face down in the holder, slide into machine, switch on, apply pressure using the tension bar and the watermark appears. To aid viewing the T1 has an adjustable internal light source to help distinguish the watermark. If there is a watermark, it will show, even on yellow or orange stamps. This model operates on 5 "AA" batteries or an AC Adapter (part #9887 - the adapter - not included). Original 1984 Retail Price of the Signoscope =	$210.00	$270.00
6001
