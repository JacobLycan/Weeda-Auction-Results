6108
101	Canada #463viii. Exceptional in every respect, a pristine MNH half pane of 25 of the 15c dull purple Centennial high value.

117	Canada #1535ii. The rare and unissued 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate change, VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2023 Unitrade =	$600.00	$325.00
6378
118	Canada #1764b. VF MNH right hand sheet margin example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Unitrade states that fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2022 Unitrade =	$500.00	$110.00
6211

Estimate =	$1,000.00	$350.00
6378
120	Canada #2027/3042. VF MNH assemblage of 74 all different souvenir sheets, 2004-2017 issues, with individual face values to $2.50 plus the Canadian Flag, Star Trek and Toronto Maple Leafs $5 high values.

Includes a regular S/S for comparison. 2023 Unitrade =	$275.00	$110.00
5424
122	Canada #3260ii. After 2 full cycles of 12 Lunar New Year issues from 1997 to 2020, in January 2021 Canada Post recapped the second series by reissuing the previous 12 designs in 3 formats: a self-adhesive booklet, a gummed pane of 12 and an uncut press sheet of 12 souvenir sheets. Released while the COVID pandemic was in full swing this issue was highly sought-after and sold out within a couple of weeks, with the press sheets soon being resold online for hundreds of dollars. There are 2 sheet types with either "8:51:46 AM" timing printed at the bottom of the sheet or "3:53:18 PM" timing with a squiggly line flaw on the Monkey stamp; the AM sheet offered here without the "squiggle" is much scarcer. Post Office fresh condition in the original tube. 2023 Unitrade =	$375.00	$220.00

5595

2271
149	Canada - A bankers box crammed full with tens of thousands of mostly modern & recent used, mostly on close-cut, single paper.

5700

6330
151	Canada - Collection #4/699 plus Back of the Book. All used 1852 to 1976 period collection, all still mounted in a Scott Specialty album. In the mix noted a 3 Penny Beaver, First Cents, Large and Small Queens, some Jubilees, Leafs, Numerals, Edwards, Admirals and then comprehensive to the early 1950s. The Back of the Book section has decent representation of airmails, special deliveries, postage dues, etc. If you are interested in starting a used Canadian collection, this is the lot for you. 2022 Scott US$3,540.00=	$4,779.68	$230.00
6025
152	Canada - Collection, neatly house in two immaculate "Unity" brand stamp albums (with slipcases) with pages from 1851 to 1983. The used stamps are hinged on the album pages, with the mint nicely arranged in Hagner brand stocksheets alongside. This also results in dozen of pristine condition Hagner stocksheets included, worth a fair penny in their own regard. The stamps start in the “Cents” issue, with a good showing of QV to GeoVI, but with much mixed condition, especially in the early stamps. The post 1950 material adds up quickly, with a face value alone of $333.98. A great lot with room for expansion, housed in nice albums ready to be added to. Estimate =	$400.00	$375.00
6301
153	Canada - Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing a souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly (impossible to find) and dog (almost as hard to find) thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. These sets have and will increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$120.00
3587
154	Canada - Enticing lot of about 435 unused postal stationery envelopes, postcards, letter cards, aerogrammes, Certified Mail and a few other Canada Post items, from QV to QEII eras.

With some patience and the Webb catalogue the upside could be significant! Estimate =	$120.00	$140.00
6150
155	Canada - Excellent lot of used constant plate varieties, EFOs and errors in approximately 350 dealer 102 cards, many stuffed full. Includes tagging errors and varieties, untagged errors, nearly imperf coils with blind perfs, paper fluorescence varieties, miscut coils, misperf singles, and other valuable items such as the "doubling of 6" variety #460iv. Useful heavy duplication in places with a huge potential retail value when counted by the Unitrade catalogue and the Adminware tagging error database. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
2751
156	Canada - GeoV Admiral and Lathework Themed Group. Balance of consignment containing GeoV era material, all laid out on one Hagner stock sheet, strong in Admirals and lathework.

6025
157	Canada - GeoV Period Mint Stock. All mint selection of 1911 to 1935 period GeoV definitives and commemoratives, all neatly laid out on three Hagner brand stock sheets. The condition is mostly F/VF and runs from (a few) no gum to (some) NH with the vast majority OG Hinged. While there are no dollar values in the mix, there is a decent range of medium value stamps in the lot with a reasonable amount of duplication. A great lot for the internet/show dealer or collector wishing to build up a stock of traders. All valued as Hinged. 2023 Scott US$2,099.35=	$2,834.12	$75.00
6025

VF MNH lot of seventeen complete panes of 50 or 100, including QEII Karsh, Wilding and Cameo definitive issues as well as precancelled Floral definitives and paper varieties on the "Indians of Canada" issues. A few instances of minor perf separation or folding along the perfs, and the 2c green Karsh with selvedge faults at right. Includes the semi-constant plate varieties "Extra Leaf" at position 41 of the 10c Sparrow and "Contraction" at position 97 of the 1c Decoy, where someone has helpfully marked an "X" in pencil below the variety stamp. 2023 Unitrade =	$899.00	$210.00
5531
159	Canada - Mint collection of 1970s to 1980s issues hinged and mounted on quadrille album pages with extensive typed annotations, a comprehensive collection for the period which was obviously a labour of love!

6301
160	Canada - Modern Used Commemoratives ON PAPER.

5839
161	Canada - Modern USED. A tough to find selection of 167 different latest used 2019 - 2022 issues, includes the latest Ukraine relief semi-postal (be careful, this stamp is identical to Canada #2444, but the text is different) and the 'Thanks Merci!' flying postal truck issued only to postal employees. 88 are COVID period issues, oh so scarce used since so few people now use stamps. As an added bonus, a used example of the $5 cloth flag stamp #2808i and the $10 whale #2405 are included! Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
5700
162	Canada - Modern USED. The "P" Commemoratives ONLY - One pound used on close-cut single paper, only true commemoratives, NO Christmas, No Spring Flowers, No Definitives! Loaded with COVID period issues! Estimate	$170.00	$130.00

This once, non-traditional group of items offered by Canada Post, these no longer need to hide in the shadows and are sought out by collectors looking to check off many of these "back-of-the-book" listed items from their want lists. Estimate =	$160.00	$110.00
5898
164	Canada - Parallel mint and used collection in 2 Lindner hingeless albums with slipcases, 1977 to 1995 issues, arranged with MNH stamps in the pockets and used stamps hinged to the page beneath.

6039
165	Canada - Parallel mint and used collection in 2 Lindner hingeless albums with slipcases, 1995 to 2003 issues, mostly arranged with MNH stamps in the pockets and used stamps hinged to the page beneath.

Total Face value =	$273.20	$280.00
6108
166	Canada - Part 2 of an instant dealer's stock (see the other parts under "Worldwide" in this sale) containing MNH, mint hinged and used issues of Canada from 1897 to 1983 including Back of the Book. All meticulously identified and priced on 90 dealer cards in a small 3-ring album.

6301
167	Canada - Pre-Packaged Stamps. Very rare and pristine, superb quality group of Canada Post produced and recently Unitrade listed "Pre-Packaged Stamps" marketed by the Post Office in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The group consists of 9 listed types, identifiable in Unitrade (page 686 in the 2023 Edition) by cross checking the issue prices and number of stamps in each as well as the years and types of stamps contained in each pack. Also in the lot are two as of yet unlisted packs (Stamp Starter Kit No.1 "A" and Stamp Starter Kit No.1 "B"), each containing late 1960s/early 1970s commemoratives and definitives. Almost all of these packs were torn open at the time, leaving very few intact. The cellophane packaging is also very fragile and usually found in damaged condition. These packs are all still in PERFECT condition. These "prototype" stamp packs are much rarer than any thematic collection, quarterly pack or annual collection (including the 1974 which catalogues for $250.00!). Don't miss your chance, as a selection as nice as this hardly ever comes along. Estimate =	$250.00	$110.00
6012
168	Canada - Recent USED Souvenir Sheets. A nice offering of 29 souvenir sheets, all from the 2011-2022 period (with most being newer than 2020). Most are neatly cancelled, and survived the gauntlet of the modern postal service reasonably well. A couple on large cut piece, but the remainder are off-paper, ready for your Canada album. Estimate =	$120.00	$170.00
3902
169	Canada - Small U-Haul box of used Canada collections in a stockbook, Darnell album and 2 sets of drawers. The green stockbook contains modern high values as well as earlier issues going back to late Queen Victoria, the album is in VF condition with an apparently complete set of pages to 1969 and sparsely filled though with few faults and a decent selection of KGV Admirals, and the drawers are filled with stamps neatly organized in 102 dealer cards or glassine envelopes. Offered as received and unchecked by us for ANY varieties. Estimate =	$110.00	$55.00
5841
170	Canada - Souvenir Sheets USED. Offering of 66 different modern, all postally used and scarce thus! Some with gum were protected in separate cover. See scan for issues. 2022 Unitrade =	$412.00	$200.00
3902
171	Canada - Special Event, Custom and Commemorative Envelopes, produced by Canada Post. An enticing group of 91, seemingly all different illustrated special issue covers 1991-2019. These Unitrade listed covers have been gaining in popularity over the past number of years and finding them can be a challenge. Here is a nice chance to getting a running start if you have been neglecting these issues, or fill in some gaps in a pre-existing collection. While most catalogue $2-$6 each, finding them has been much tougher than the list price indicates. Estimate =	$160.00	$160.00
6350
172	Canada - Used ALL-DIFFERENT modern mix. A nice array of 490 all different issues, all issued in the 21st century, all neatly organized on black stocksheets. With many of the later issues being the "P" self-adhesive stamps, which having them already off paper saves a great deal of soaking (which can be much more tedious for the self-adhesive issues). A nice chance to fill some of the holes in your recent Canada! Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
6126
173	Canada - Used assemblage of Classic and Modern Canada, with a collection in 4 Unity albums covering the years 1870-2000, a Lindner 18-ring album with slightly organized issues on pages, a red stockbook with some duplicated definitives and commemoratives, and 3 Annual Collection books partly filled with used stamps. All 5 of the albums come with slipcases. A useful range of material and getting four albums with an apparently complete set of pages at once is a boon. Estimate =	$200.00	$190.00
5841
174	Canada Cancels - A large shoe box filled with clippings from mail over the last 10 years or so, all selected for a collection of modern postmarks. Largely Western Canada, with strength in British Columbia. This is a "cream of the crop" offering, neatly clipped by a collector that had access to thousands of pieces of mail put aside from him from a large business mailroom. The real draw to this lot (in our opinion) is the wide array of named retail centre postmarks of BC (Pine Centre, Prince George…as an example). Many of these modern postmarks are relatively unknown to most BC postmark collectors. The cancels in this lot formed the basis for many of the new post offices of BC reported in the BC postal history study group newsletter. As little is known as to the opening (and sometimes quite quick closing, or name change) of these "modern" offices, some are likely quite scarce. Thousands of cancels here. Estimate =	$180.00	$42.00
6012
175	Canada Cancels - British Columbia MOON cancels from Victoria BC. A seldom seen selection of 59 MOONs on stamps, pieces, or PO receipts + 4 covers, mostly all different. 1956 - 1972. All long obsolete now, and very scarce. Tough to find material. Estimate =	$100.00	$120.00
1393
176	Canada Cancels - British Columbia. A trio of BC postmark rarities on stamp / piece. A seldom seen selection, all of which are from post offices which have only had a few reports of postmarks each. The lot includes Chamadaska 1920 (being the latest known date), Harbledown 1909 and Schooner Passage 1921 (also the latest known date). A great lot for the BC postmark collector to (likely) knock 3 off the list in one-shot! Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
1393
177	Canada Cancels - RPO Railway Post Office. An accumulation of 500 RPO cancels on stamp (mostly) or small piece, with each item hinged on a small black card and identified with Ludlow RPO numbers, housed in a red "102 card" box. QV to QEII, with many Victorian stamps. Also included, but not factored into the above total are four packets (likely a few hundred stamps) of unsorted RPO cancels. Strength in Western Canadian RPO runs. A great lot for the RPO hunter. Estimate =	$180.00	$160.00
4858
178	Canada Cancels - Shoebox stuffed with a collector’s assortment of several hundred postmarks QV to QEII on stamp / piece, with strength in the Pre-WWII material. Although there are cancels from across the country, the real strength western Canada (Saskatchewan in particular). Lots of better items throughout, sorted into envelopes, loose and on "102" cards. A good sort will surely be rewarded on this one! Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00
6012
179	Canada Covers #4 on 1854 Folded Letter. Four margin example of the imperf Three Penny Beaver on wove paper, tied to a VF condition January 13th 1854 folded letter, Toronto to Balmoral UC with January 19th Cayuga UC transit on reverse (Balmoral is around 10 kilometers west of Cayuga). The letter concerns the regulations involved in the building the local school, with reference also made to the school texts that had already been sent in advance. 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$180.00
5726
180	Canada Covers - Airmail FFC (First Flight Cover) accumulation in a small box. An attractive little group of 106 covers, from the late 1920’s to the late 1940’s with the majority being from the hay-day of Airmail Routes during the 1930’s. Noted a couple Pilot Signed, along with a couple of Cherry Red Airline semi-official airmail covers. With the new AAMC airmail catalogue for Canada being fresh of the press, these are surely to gain even more traction with collectors in the years to come. Estimate =	$140.00	$160.00
4871
181	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. A varied selection of 16 better covers and cards, selected for postmarks with the majority being Split Ring cancel types.

The pages include Pioneer Mine, Garbaldi, Seton Lake, Squamish, Brackendale. A great specialized lot for the postal historian. Estimate =	$180.00	$160.00
4178
184	Canada Covers - British Columbia. Lajoie Falls 1915 Split Ring cancel on piece. A cut portion from the "Sea to Sky Region" collection of renowned BC postal historian Andrew Scott. This cancel represents the only known example of the postmark from this short-lived Post Office open only 2 years (1914-1916). The townsite, named after local entrepreneur and "mountain man" Lazack Lajoie. The Lajoue Dam and powerhouse, built in 1948 to contain the reservoir of Downton Lake, now occupy this site. A must-have for the BC postal historian. Estimate =	$250.00	$160.00
1393

4440
186	Canada Covers - Commercial Airways, Semi-Official Airmails. An attractive group of four covers, featuring 3 different Commercial Airways semi-official airmail stamps (CL47x2, CL48, CL49). Each cover is carried on a first flight airmail route in Northern Alberta (Edmonton, Grande Prairie, Fort McMurray and Peace River). These ever-popular covers are likely to grow in demand with the new edition of the AAMC airmail catalogue for Canada recently printed. 2023 Unitrade =	$600.00	$180.00
3850
187	Canada Covers - CPR Canadian Pacific Railway. A CPR Railway related offering which includes 21 Queen Victoria to George V illustrated stationery postcards (unchecked by us), 9 QEII railway advice postcards (CNR railway too) and 4 CPR Steamships lettercards. The latter included a quite interesting use sent from Hong Kong in 1936 from someone aboard the SS Empress of Asia to Germany. Estimate =	$140.00	$170.00
3333
188	Canada Covers - FDC - First Day Covers. A bankers box, absolutely jammed packed with over 3500 first day covers. The owner’s count on these appears to be accurate, reports to include 982 Canada Post issue FDC (with 192 being the "small size" 1970’s FDC), 1468 FDC with either no cachet or no illustration and 1068 Private Cachet FDC. Noted private cachets by NR, Brickley-Jones, Rose Craft, Cole, JCR, H&E and Fleetwood. Although nothing seemed to stand-alone in this lot.

The lot also includes a MH/NH block of 4 of the 50c Vancouver Harbour 1938 issue with Type O10 perfin - given the recent reorganization in the Unitrade catalogue this combination is unlisted, suggesting this block might be a post-contemporary fake as the second 4-hole type only came into use with the War Issue of 1942.

5841
204	Canada Revenues #BCF1l/BCF9. Complete exceptionally high quality run of the first nine (1989-90 to 1997-98 seasons) Federal Tidal Sport Fishing licences, all with the additional affixed Salmon Conservation stamps required in order to catch and retain salmon in British Columbia waters. The Van Dam catalogue has a value for the used stamp on license (@ $20.00) but we rarely see these as most anglers toss them out after the season is over. Also, most of the licenses that we do see are frequently severely torn, tattered and stained, often smelling slightly of kippers and back pockets. This group of ten licenses (only the 1995-96 duplicated) are the nicest offering of these intact documents that we've handled. Severely undervalued material, especially this nice. 2022 Van Dam =	$200.00	$55.00

Expect the odd fault, but as we are offering these as received, we have not checked them for perfs and printings. Valued only at the basic Scott listing. Total 2023 Scott US$1486.50 =	$2,006.78	$140.00
6395

5963
211	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #2, 5, 6, 7. Used quartet of 1860 to 1865 pre-Confederation BC and Vancouver Island issues, each one with some kind of fault (marginal nick, trimmed wing margins, clipped perfs).

The pages appear to be complete, but we have not fully checked the run (although blank Scott pages can be easily ordered to add where you like).

175	Canada Revenues #FB37/FB51. Mint stock of second-quality 1868 Third Bill issue Federal revenues from a retired dealer, apparently all NH but with no premiums added as most have faults from minor to major including creases and pulled perfs. Not checked for any paper types or perf varieties, some of which carry a substantial premium now that they are listed in the van Dam catalogue. A total of 367 stamps including marginal markings. Note that the catalogue value is for sound stamps, of which there are few here. 2022 van Dam =	$1,859.00	$65.00

6012
179	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #3. Roughly cut used example of the 1865 issue 5c rose "Victoria". While this stamp exists in both imperforate and perforated states (with the perforated type being much cheaper), the margin at left plus the margins at top and bottom offer a plausible argument for this being the scarcer imperf type (a #3 catalogues for US$11,000.00 in Scott) rather than a trimmed #5. Are you willing to roll the dice? Estimate =	$325.00	$120.00

A mixed mint and used collection neatly arranged in TWO Scott International green albums (new style, 3-ring holed) with slipcases (retail over $300 alone).

6136
197	Chile - A duplicated collector's stock of Mint and Used stamps, neatly arranged on stockpages within a binder. The stamps have been laid out in Scott numbering order, with some better noted.

VF+ example of the rare and extremely popular 1980 issue "Year of the Monkey" Lunar New Year stamp on an unaddressed, cacheted, premium "red cancel" First Day Cover. Perfect condition, no toning or faults. The buy price for this key modern cover is very close to the full Scott catalogue value for the mint stamp and the FDC is actually much scarcer!

2958
207	China - PRC #1696/2191. 1981 to 1988 issue VF MNH sets, singles and blocks of 4 plus many S/S and "commemorative sheet" which resemble souvenir sheets but have no postal validity.

4389
210	Cuba - Accumulation on album pages, in envelopes and in a retired APS circuit book, consisting of mint and used sets, singles and souvenir sheets with a particular emphasis on airmail issues.

5931
214	Denmark - Two Album Pages with over 60 different mint and (mostly) used 1850s to 1930s period issues, all still Hinged on the original cut-down album pages.

Although we are not certain of the year of the Scott catalogue used, it is certainly over 10 years old! Owner's older Scott US$790.00 =	$1,066.50	$230.00
5028
218	Egypt - A collector's duplicated Mint and Used stock of mostly UAR issues, neatly arranged on stockpages within a binder.

5931
229	France #1429/3299. An enticing group of 88 different mint NH souvenir sheets and miniature sheets, 1975-2007. All are post office fresh and feature a nice variety of topical themes as found on the French commemorative issues.

Mixed condition, almost all used selection of 220 duplicated 1862 to 1937 period issues, Victorias, Edwards and Georges, all laid out chronologically on four Hagner stock sheets (carefully checked for watermarks). The consignor has not valued what they consider to be severely damaged stamps.

6087

4858
309	Indian States Gwalior #90-96, 112, 114-117. Lovely F/VF mint selection of 12 different 1938 to 1949 overprinted Indian issues. The 1938-1940 3p to 6a low value set of seven is Hinged but the five 1945-1949 issue large format 1r, 5r, 10r, 15r and 25r high values are all pristine OG NH. The original dealer's 10 year+ old lot description and net price (US$) is included with the lot. Scarce material! 2023 Scott Classic US$448.00=	$604.80	$250.00

77
314	Ireland - A collector's conglomerated duplicated Mint and (mostly) Used stock on homemade pages, album pages, stocksheets - all put together within a binder. The owner report's that the catalogue value is over US$1850.00 in Scott, we have decided to estimate this lot based on the somewhat disorganized array of material.

4686
317	Italy - A collector's conglomeration of pages, packet, stocksheets and more, packed into a small box. Several hundred stamps here, from early issues to the 1970's. Although somewhat disorganized, potential lurks for someone to sit down with the catalogue and give these a good sort. Estimate =	$100.00	$70.00
5931
318	Italy - Over 325 stamps, neatly arranged and organized on old dealer stock "102" cards from the 19th century to the 1970's with the vast majority of the material being pre WWII.

77

324	Jersey #4/639, J1-J46, N1-N8. Mint and 99% NH nearly complete collection for the 1943 to 1993 period, neatly laid out in a Stanley Gibbons padded hingeless album. A total of 675 stamps, 7 souvenir sheets and 1 booklet. Sadly, the top of the album has split and the first page has had the mounts react (likely) with the plastic softener of the inner album witch has caused the mount to shrink / adhere to the stamp. It is possible that these stamps could be salvaged, but we did not count in them in the total and would leave it as-is for the purchaser to do as they please. Besides that, a very clean lot. 2022 Scott US$536.35 =	$724.07	$90.00
6200
325	Korea - Over 220 stamps, neatly arranged on old dealer stock "102" cards from the late 19th century to the 1970's Duplicated in areas and with some faults noted, these cards were originally catalogued in 2006 by the previous owner. Owner's much older 2006 Scott US$391.00 =	$527.85	$55.00

The original owner catalogued these stamps out at US$754.45 (over $1000 Canadian) back in 2006. Mildly duplicated, and although the condition is mixed (especially in the earlier issues), there are still lots of useful stamps mixed throughout. Estimate =	$100.00	$80.00
5993
328	Macao #2/28. Used sets and singles of 1884-87 issues with the "Portuguese Crown" design and surcharges. The 80r on 100r circle surcharge is #16b without the accent on the "e" and has a thin. 2021 Scott US$309.00 =	$417.15	$130.00

Amateurishly mounted but otherwise clean and F/VF condition 1950s to 1980s period collection/selection of stamps (mostly regular and airmail issues) plus First Day Covers and Maximum Cards. All housed in two binders. Completely unchecked for catalogue value but there are almost always "sleepers" for watermarks or perfs in this time period. Most of the mint stamps are in blocks of four. Take a good look at the scans! Looks like a fun sorting project for the both the Mexico and topical collector. Estimate =	$200.00	$42.00
5898
332	Monaco #3/122. Group of early used issues from 1885 to 1937, a few have a rounded corner else mostly fine. We note several CDS cancels including some fully dated. 2023 Scott US$514.50 =	$694.55	$38.00

Clean and neatly mounted mint Hinged and used 1873 to 1975 period collection of regular, semi-postal, airmail, airmail semi-postal and postage due stamps, all still mounted on the original album pages.

Clean and neatly mounted mint Hinged and used 1864 to 1949 period collection of regular, semi-postal, airmail, official and postage due stamps, all still mounted on the original album pages. While not complete, this lot is usefully comprehensive with a good number of complete sets and better values in the mix. An enlightening look into the Dutch colonial past in the present-day country of Indonesia and a difficult group to assemble. Note that the stamps laid out on the Hagner stock sheet have been transferred from the original album pages for safety (they were loose). They were valued when they were still on the album pages so the individual page totals may occasionally be out of line. 2022 Scott US$1,554.60=	$2,098.71	$180.00
5295
338	New Zealand #9/118. Two stock page offering of 99 duplicated used 1857 to 1907 period issues.

6104
339	New Zealand #122-125. Christchurch Exhibition issue mint, hinged. Rough perforations are normal for this issue, thus a few short perfs. Wee tiny perf stain on back of 1/2d, otherwise a rarely seen and beautiful set! 2022 Scott US$461.00 =	$622.35	$120.00

All housed in Hingeless mounts on well laid out and informative 3-ring "NuLine" album pages.

351	Russia - A collection (lightly duplicated) of Mint and Used, laid out on home-made album pages in TWO 2-inch binders. A diverse offering, from early issues up the 1990's (with a few even more modern). The previous owner reports that the Scott catalogue value is over US$3200.00, but further work is needed to properly identify the earlier issues and much of the modern "used" is CTO cancelled to order material. A nice lot to sit down and sort out over a weekend. Estimate =	$140.00	$160.00

These stamps were intended for use on a proposed submarine mail route from Barcelona to Mahon (Minorca). This particular "MUESTRA" (specimen/sample) overprinted set was sent by Spanish and UPU officials as a sample of current Spanish issues to Postmasters of foreign post offices. Valued as a regular NH set but much scarcer. 2023 Scott Classic US$425.00=	$531.25	$170.00

Clean and neatly mounted mint Hinged and used 1873 to 1975 period collection of regular, semi-postal, airmail, semi-postal airmail and postage due stamps and souvenir sheets, all still mounted on the original album pages.

An informative look into the Dutch colonial past in the Americas and a difficult group to assemble. 2022 Scott US$1,010.75=	$1,364.51	$170.00
6036
358	Sweden #7/218, J1/J22, O3/O18. All used (or no gum valued as used) 1858 to 1924 period selection of 20 different stamps, both regular and "Back of the Book" issues. A couple of stamps with small faults noted for the record. 2023 Scott US$1,211.50=	$1,635.53	$130.00

Estimate =	$240.00	$120.00
2951
362	Switzerland - A somewhat messy accumulation of mint and used stamps and souvenir sheets going back to the early imperf Sitting Helvetia issues, including 3 stamps (Scott #64 and #65) expertized and signed with accompanying certificates from Werner Liniger and Walter Abt. The Classic issues of this country present a pleasantly challenging area with many (sometimes) subtle varieties in the paper, gum and perforations.

365	Thailand - An array of 114 First Day Covers or Special Event Cancel covers from the 1957-1995 period. This interesting offering features many of the attractive stamp sets of the period.

Estimate =	$100.00	$32.00
4858
366	Togo - An absolutely incredible run of 8 Palo albums, giving the run of stamps of Togo from 1897-2010. Several hundred mint and used stamps scattered throughout (see pictures). Note the pages as produced by PALO have full colour examples printed on the album pages, so look closely to determine which stamps have been placed over-top, and which are just part of the printed page. Easily one of the nicest set of albums we have ever handled in the past few years, with a good run of issues already in-place giving you a hefty foot-in-the door to collecting this popular West African Nation. Estimate =	$650.00	$160.00

Although the majority of the stamps in this album are hinged, the highest value set (Vietnam #1-13, catalogue US$250.00) is Mint Never-Hinged. A great foot-in-the-door to collecting this very popular country. Total 2022 Scott US$1616.05 =	$2,181.67	$300.00

23	Bangkok #7/19. Mint and used reference lot of Straits Settlements stamps overprinted ‘B’ for use in Bangkok. Scott notes ‘excellent counterfeits are plentiful’ and there are perhaps a couple genuine examples (one of the 4c brown has 2 expertization/owner marks on reverse) amid the certainly forged overprints - for example the 96c olive grey has the ‘B’ clearly printed OVER the postmarks. The Scott catalogue value for genuine examples is US$6847.50 - these will serve as excellent placeholders or as useful fodder for study. Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00

Exceptional quality and complete ALL CHOICE VF USED 1935 George V Silver Jubilee Omnibus set, including both the common design and non-common design types.

Here's your chance to acquire a "top shelf" quality popular and classic Omnibus set with all the hard work already done! 2023 Scott US$2,231.00=	$3,011.85	$575.00

6087
42	Burma #2/416, O56/2N64. VF condition decorative stockbook with a reasonably comprehensive collection of 1937-2015 issues from Burma and Myanmar, 339 stamps mostly mint hinged and including more interesting Back of the Book. The 3 copies of 2N1 are forgeries with two so stamped on the reverse. A couple of the Japanese occupation ‘Peacock’ handstamp overprints look OK but none are expertized thus have not been counted in the catalogue value. 2021 Scott US$1040.35 =	$1,404.47	$150.00
5724

3556
57	Canada #37 ESSAY. Listed in Minuse and Pratt's "The Essays and Proofs of British North America" as #37E-Ad, this Very Fine condition 3c Queen Victoria lithographed plate essay in red orange, printed on smooth coated thick (.0038) glazed white paper is considered by many to be a Large Queen/Small Queen crossover piece.

60	Canada #60ii. VF+ large margined used example of the Unitrade listed pale blue ("powder blue") shade of the 1897 issue 50c Queen Victoria Jubilee. Beautifully centered. This shade is unlisted in Scott. Note that this stamp still has full Never Hinged gum and has a very light corner cancel so it was probably cancelled to order at the time. The cancel was an old-time steel hammer but I wasn't able to determine the post office from the several letters impressed by the cancel. 2023 Unitrade =	$350.00	$150.00
1786
61	Canada #62. Sound and F/VF used example of the $2.00 dark purple 1897 issue Queen Victoria Jubilee. Clear "UNION STN TORONTO 1" roller cancel. "J. H. Stolow" guarantee handstamp on reverse. 2023 Scott US$450.00=	$607.50	$110.00

6274
71	Canada #86. MAJOR RE-ENTRY. VF mint NH example of the 1898 issue 2c Xmas Map, deep blue oceans, showing a major re-entry (but not the Unitrade #86iii which is plate 5, position 91). This particular stamp is according to Ralph Trimble's re-entries.com site, plate Position 2A17. According to Trimble "This stamp shows markings in CANADA POSTAGE, especially notable in the 'T,' doubling of the left cable, both 2's, a series of 'hooks' below the left numeral box, XMAS, and the distinctive column 7 re-entry line in the lower half of "WE HOLD A VASTER EMPIRE THAN HAS BEEN." Very conservatively valued as a regular VFNH #86b by Unitrade. 2023 Unitrade =	$225.00	$150.00

These three stamps come from a collection that was sold through a large eastern Canadian auction, identified by their Admiral expert. These shades tend to be very nuanced, requiring good lighting to differentiate properly. 2023 Unitrade =	$390.00	$290.00
4464
76	Canada #123/230. Complete run of all the GeoV 1912 to 1935 period coils, all in F/VF mint OG Hinged condition. Expect the odd small fault (slightly trimmed perfs, etc..). Noted some very nice VF stamps in the mix. 2023 Scott US$783.00 =	$1,057.05	$110.00

6025
79	Canada #149/271. GeoV / GeoVI selection of 67 blocks, plate-blocks and booklet panes, neatly arranged on stocksheets. Mostly lightly-hinged, with some NH mixed throughout, this lightly duplicated selection features many better items which can be elusive to find (such as the variations of GeoVI War Issue booklets panes). 2023 Unitrade =	$489.35	$140.00
4249
80	Canada #158. Fresh and VF mint OG NH example of the iconic 50c Bluenose high value from the 1928-1929 KGV Scroll issue. Great colour, pristine gum.

A very high quality group of sets, most of the stamps in VF condition. 2023 Scott US$419.40 =	$566.19	$80.00
5841
83	Canada #249. Fold-Over Error. Mint Hinged lower left corner plate #25 inscription pair of theGeoVI 1c green from the 1942-1943 War Issue series, the left-hand stamp missing the left hand "1" from the design due to a printing fold-over. The "missing" 1 is actually printed on the reverse of the pair. A nice "front and back" error. Estimate =	$200.00	$170.00
6012
84	Canada #302. The High-Value $1 Fisheries issue of 1951, group of 85 copies used IN-PERIOD in various configurations (some in addition to other period issues) on parcel pieces sent out of Vancouver BC. An old-time holding of these high value stamps, which have not been offered on the market in decades. A choice group, with many BLOCKS cancelled with either a light roller or CDS postmark. The catalogue value of the $1 Fisheries stamps alone is $1260.00 (counted as 84 used copies, as one has an obvious tear). A nice opportunity to acquire a seldom seen offering of High-Value multiples. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
5735

6039
89	Canada #1395a. Mint NH imperforate pair of the 1992 issue 43c olive green Flag coil on DF paper. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$65.00
6012
90	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c values for the 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2023 Unitrade =	$800.00	$375.00
6415
91	Canada #2012/2304a. Fascinating group of 5 COUNTERFEIT complete booklets produced with the intention of defrauding Canada Post, many reportedly created in the Baltic states of Eastern Europe by former intelligence service agents. Lot consists of 4 booklets of 10 accompanied by detailed retail tags highlighting important characteristics and a booklet of 6 with a copy of an extensive article published in 2006.

This Bower favour autographed #2017 is considerably rarer. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
5915
93	Canada #2844 First Day Cover. Extremely rare official Canada Post cacheted First Day Cover of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo" stamp (#2844a). The souvenir sheet on FDC is FAR AND AWAY the key Hoodoo item. This particular FDC was a presentation piece given by Canada Post to VIPs attending the official stamp launch and the lot includes the original presentation folder. Consistently increasing in catalogue value in Unitrade and then often selling for over catalogue anyway! 2023 Unitrade =	$650.00	$525.00
1786

After 2 full cycles of 12 Lunar New Year issues from 1997 to 2020, in January 2021 Canada Post recapped the second series by reissuing the previous 12 designs in 3 formats: a self-adhesive booklet, a gummed pane of 12 and an uncut press sheet of 12 souvenir sheets. Released while the COVID pandemic was in full swing this issue was highly sought-after and sold out within a couple of weeks, with the press sheets soon being resold online for hundreds of dollars. There are 2 sheet types with either "8:51:46 AM" timing printed at the bottom of the sheet or "3:53:18 PM" timing with a squiggly line flaw on the Monkey stamp; the AM sheet offered here without the "squiggle" is much scarcer. Post Office fresh condition in the original tube. 2023 Unitrade =	$375.00	$230.00

6128
98	Canada #BK302b. VF quality NEARLY COMPLETE (22 of 25 total) collection of all different back cover designs (5 different scenes with 5 different background colours) of the December 2004 issue "narrow" 29-slit roulette 50c "Flag Over" booklet series. Needless to say, a very diffficult group to assemble. Nice to have 90% of the work already done for you! Overlooked by most modern booklet collectors. Total face value of the booklets is $110.00 but worth a premium due to the difficulty of assembling the set. 2023 Unitrade =	$264.00	$220.00

294	Liberia - Specialized Collection Assembled by Kasimir Bileski. Stupendous offering of Liberian postage stamps in complete mint NH sets, plus revenues, proofs, specimens, progressive essays, errors and more, all assembled by Kasimir Bileski, the famous Winnipeg stamp dealer and philatelic promoter. Over the years, Kasimir developed a soft spot for Liberian stamps, scouring international auctions, befriending designers, artists and Liberian postal officials, giving him access to unusual material unavailable to the general public. In the 1980s and 1990s he began putting together offerings of specialized Liberian philatelic items for preferred clients. This particular lot includes an accumulation most of the Liberian material that Kasimir had for sale, as well as the write-ups that accompanied the "special offers". The original (30 year old) cost of the contents of this lot was easily over $1,500.00 As a whole, this assemblage would make a fascinating exhibit, not only as a Liberian study but also as an example of the marketing brilliance of ostensibly Canada's greatest stamp dealer.

104	Canada #249a/306b. Fresh and all mint NH selection of 19 different 1942 to 1951 GeoVI booklet panes. A very clean group, with the vast majority in Very Fine condition. Includes both tab sizes for the 4c dark carmine War issue pane of six. Lots of upside if valued by Unitrade. 2023 Scott US$132.75=	$179.21	$55.00
6387
105	Canada #263-267, 278-281. Fresh and select quality VF+ mint NH complete run of all nine different GeoVI War Issue coils, all in strips of four, consisting of the original 1942-1943 issue perf 8 issues as well as the scarcer 1948 issue perf 9½ issues. Unitrade is $504.00 for the VF+ mint NH strips. Worthy of the finest collection. 2023 Scott US$347.00=	$468.45	$300.00
6201
106	Canada #337p/610p. Mint NH Winnipeg and General Tagged Stock. Clean and all mint NH duplicated but balanced mint NH stock of tagged material (both Winnipeg and Ottawa general , running from the 1962 Wilding definitive issues up to the 1972 issue 8c Kreighoff commemorative. No high value Centennials, Cameos of Landscapes noted but lots of Christmas issues including the 5c and 6c 1970 Childrens' Drawings in tagged corner blocks of 10, plate blocks of the 15c Radio Canada and corner blocks of many other issues. A perfect lot for the dealer looking for useful tagged material. 2023 Unitrade over $1,000.00. Estimate =	$250.00	$170.00
5290
107	Canada #405bq. Wholesale batch of the 5c blue QEII Cameo issue Winnipeg Tagged miniature pane of 20, all VF Mint Never-Hinged. A total of 9 sheets, all still on original Saskatoon Stamp Centre sales cards. A nice batch for the show / internet dealer, or collector looking to bolster their holdings. 2023 Unitrade =	$495.00	$32.00
5977
108	Canada #405bq, 458bp. Wholesale lot of VF MNH W2B Winnipeg tagged miniature panes of 20, five each of the 5c violet blue Cameo and 5c blue Centennial issues. 2022 Unitrade =	$650.00	$44.00
5977
109	Canada #451bq / 476bq. Wholesale batch of the 1966 / 1967 Christmas issue "Cello-panes" with 70 packs of each (140 cello-packs, 2 panes of 25 stamps in each package). Both issues come in "Canadian Bank Note Company" boxes (in damaged, but still decent shape considering they are over 55 years old). The boxes themselves are likely quite hard to come by, we have only seen a few over the years. Sadly, it appears that the pair of panes inside all each of the cello-packs have adhered to each other. Valued as panes, the potential 2023 Unitrade catalogue value would be $1750.00! Estimate =	$120.00	$32.00
5977
110	Canada #466xx. Wholesale grouping 25 strips of four, plus 2 pairs of the 3c dull purple precancelled QEII Centennial issue coil on plain paper. All are Fine / VF, Mint (unused) with full Never-Hinged gum. A nice lot for the show / internet dealer, or QEII specialist. 2023 Unitrade =	$364.00	$36.00
3438
111	Canada #519-528, 519p-528p. Christmas 1970, a Bileski inspired accumulation of what the previous owner believes to be all the different block combinations possible from this popular Christmas issue in USED condition (Winnipeg CDS) including 522i / 522pi / 525i / 525pi (2023 Unitrade Catalogue $480.00 alone), plus some additional mint material included two examples of each of the 522i / 525i centre blocks (MNH, 2023 Unitrade $160.00 for the 4 blocks). An interesting study. Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
6275
112	Canada #522i / 522pi / 525i / 525pi. Superb set of the 1970 Christmas issue centre blocks of four, both regular and Winnipeg tagged on Bileski cachet First Day Covers. An attractive and clean set, of which we often only see single examples. Nice to get the whole set at once. 2023 Unitrade =	$500.00	$85.00
6035
113	Canada #1016 / 2242. Modern used stock of over 4800 used neatly sorted in three stockbooks. Average 3 to 8 examples of each, so no heavy duplication. Includes the year 2000 Millennium issues and high values. Nice clean stock for a dealer or duplicate trader. Estimate =	$150.00	$220.00
5435
114	Canada #1174, 1174a. VF mint NH matched sets of inscription blocks of the 59c Musk Ox on the original January 18th 1989 Harrison paper, perf 14.4 x 13.8 as well as on the rare November 1st 1989 Slater Paper, perf 13.1 x 13.1. High quality inscription blocks from the popular "Mammals" series. 2023 Unitrade =	$290.00	$110.00
6442
115	Canada #1176, 1176a. VF mint NH matched sets of inscription blocks of four of the 1990 issue 63c Harbour Porpoise, both on Peterborough paper, in the original perf 14.4 x 13.8 and also in the much scarcer perf 13.1 x 13.1. These are the only varieties of this stamp. The "Mammal" definitives are becoming quite a popular series. 2023 Unitrade =	$240.00	$110.00
6442
116	Canada #1178, 1178i. VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks of both the Harrison (January 18th) and Slater (August 25th) paper printings of the 1989 issue 76c Grizzly, all perf 14.4 x 13.8. Getting hard to find. 2023 Unitrade =	$150.00	$80.00
6442
117	Canada #1181, 1181ii, 1182, 1182iii. VF mint NH matched sets of inscription blocks of four of both the 1989 British American Banknote plate #1 (Harrison paper) and 1992 Canadian Bank Note plate #2 (Peterborough paper) printings of the $1.00 Runnymede Library and $2.00 McAdam Railway Station high values from the "Architecture" series. The plate #2 blocks are already not easy to find and will undoubtedly become scarcer as time goes by. 2023 Unitrade =	$340.00	$210.00
5435
118	Canada #1183, 1183i. Two VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks of four of the $5.00 "Bonsecours Market" Architecture series high value definitive, one the May 28th 1990 B A Banknote printing plate #1 on Peterborough paper, the other the much scarcer September 11th 1992 CBN printing plate #2 on Coated paper. Getting hard to find as many have been used up as high value postage. Sure to increase in value as mint quantities dwindle! 2023 Unitrade =	$600.00	$200.00
6442
119	Canada #1250ii. Upper left position VF mint NH inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative. Most inscription blocks were withdrawn due to problematic and incredibly poor printing quality. Only one inscription block was allowed per customer and only through mail order from the National Philatelic Centre. This lot comes with the original letter from Canada Post explaining / apologizing for the issue. 2023 Unitrade =	$250.00	$150.00
6052
120	Canada #1364, 1364i, 1365, 1365i, 1366, 1366b, 1369, 1369i, 1370, 1370i. VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks of four of the 49c "Delicious Apple", 50c "Snow Apple", 52c "Gravenstein Apple", 69c "Shagbark Hickory" and 71c "American Chestnut", all from different printers and on different papers. The stamps in this group exist in printings by Ashton-Potter Limited and Canadian Bank Note Company and on papers from Harrison, Peterborough and Coated Papers stock. This group represents the two types of each of these medium values that exist in sheet forms. Nice to get them all at once. 2023 Unitrade =	$455.00	$160.00
6442
121	Canada #1372, 1372i, 1373, 1373i, 1373b, 1374, 1374i. VF mint NH matched sets of plate blocks of four of the 86c "Bartlett Pear", 88c "Wescott Apricot" and 90c "Elberta Peach" all from different printers and on different papers. The stamps in this group exist in printings by Ashton-Potter Limited and Canadian Bank Note Company and on papers from Harrison, Peterborough and Coated Papers. This group represents the two or three types of each of these higher value medium values that exist in sheet forms. Nice to get them all at once, as most collectors usually missed one or two of the printings. 2023 Unitrade =	$445.00	$160.00
6442
122	Canada #1375, 1375b, 1376, 1376c. VF mint NH sets of plate blocks of four of the $1.00 Court House and $2.00 Normal School 1994-1996 issue high value Architecture definitives, consisting of both the 1994 Leigh-Mardon and 1995 Canadian Bank Note printings. Getting scarce! 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$230.00
5614
123	Canada #1395a. Mint NH imperforate pair of the 1992 issue 43c olive green Flag coil on DF paper. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$32.00
3438
124	Canada #1396a. Mint Never-Hinged imperforate strip of three of the 45c blue green stylized flag coil definitive on HB paper. The bottom stamp has a horizontal crease, so valued as a pair only. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$40.00
6360
125	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c values for the 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2023 Unitrade =	$800.00	$325.00
6442
126	Canada #1569a. IMPERFORATE SANTA LABELS. Canada Post produced labels issued and sold as promotional items for use with the 1995 issue 45c "Provinces" greetings booklet "Quick Stick" die-cuts. This particular label has a "Santa" theme and is noted on page 314 of the 2023 Unitrade catalogue. The lot consists of a regular pane of 15 labels (with die cuts) and most importantly, an error pane, IMPERFORATE and COMPLETELY WITHOUT DIE CUTS. If the imperforate pane were a denominated postage stamp and not a label, it would catalogue up to $5,000.00 (see #1601a)! We've never heard of this error, let alone seen one. Erring on a very conservative side of caution, we're estimating this pane at what we feel is a very low price. Estimate =	$325.00	$130.00
5614
127	Canada #2012a, 2014a, 2253c, 2298a, 2304a. COUNTERFEIT BOOKLET selection. An interesting group of five different self-adhesive booklets, created to defraud the Canadian Post Office. While at first glance, these booklets look good, but on closer inspection it becomes clear they are not what the purport to be (blurred images, no tagging, missing micro-printing etc). All still on original sales cards from Saskatoon Stamp Centre and accompanied by a copy of the extensive article written on this subject by Leopold Beaudet published in the Corgi Times in December 2006. Total retail as marked =	$444.35	$140.00
6022
128	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Historically the sheet has sold at (or even above) the (just priced in 2023 edition). 2023 Unitrade =	$275.00	$85.00
6442
129	Canada #2844. Rare VF MNH complete souvenir sheet of 5 of the quickly recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Canada showing an image of "Hoodoos" instead of Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta on the first $1.20 stamp. This sheet is proving to be far more elusive than the booklet. A particularly difficult issue to find and key item from the last decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign. 2023 Unitrade =	$275.00	$260.00
6052
130	Canada #BK3c (English). Fresh and VF intact 1913 issue GeoV "Admiral" booklet, front and back covers in pristine condition, serif capitals on rate sheet text, containing four panes of six of the 1c yellow green (#104a). A top quality and scarce early Admiral booklet. 2023 Unitrade =	$375.00	$190.00
6415
131	Canada #BK28b / BK38b. Selection of 10 GeoV Mufti / War Issue complete booklets, neatly arranged and identified on a double sided stocksheet. A nice clean offering, in above-average condition for this period. 2023 Unitrade =	$364.50	$100.00
5595
132	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 20 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2023 Unitrade	$1,000.00	$55.00
5526
133	Canada #BK166b / BK246b. Greeting Stamp / Picture Postage 1995-2000 booklet holding. An interesting array of 35 self-adhesive booklets (14 different types including both the "open" and "glued" varieties). These increasing popular issues make the base of what became the fascinating world of "personal picture postage" which issues now have a finite ending with Canada Post discontinuing the service. Also included in the lot (but not counted) are 14 booklets / panes of "Greeting Stickers" which could be purchased from Canada Post separately. Total face value of the useable postage alone is $94.40. 2023 Unitrade =	$307.50	$130.00
5614
134	Canada #C1-C9, CE1-CE4, E1-E11, J1-J14, J4a. All sound and F/VF mint H/NH complete collection of Airmails, Airmail Special Deliveries, Special Deliveries and Postage Dues, all neatly laid out on two Hagner stock sheets. For the sake of valuing, all the NH stamps have been left upright while all the Hinged stamps have been turned upside down for identification purposes. A perfect way to fill most of the "Back of the Book" pages in your album at once. 2023 Scott US$1,506.10=	$2,033.24	$170.00
6330
135	Canada #CP19/CP33 ERROR STRIPS. mint quartet of genuine error strips of the bug-laden kiosk computer generated postage distributed in the single Vancouver postal outlet that hosted the machines. The idea behind the program was to allow Canada Post clients to produce from the kiosk the rates that they needed in small quantities (strips of 5). Each stamp featured a landscape painting by one of five Canadian artists, including members of the renowned Group of Seven and their contemporaries. All five paintings are from the collection of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The stamps were designed by Stephane Huot and printed on Avery Dennison Paper. The denomination and numeric code were printed by direct thermal print. The stamps are available in 4 denominations: Permanent (Domestic), US rate $1.20, Oversize rate $1.80, and International rate $2.50. Each of the strips in this lot is "overlength" (one Permanent rate and one $1.20 rate are in strips of 8, plus a strip of 6 of another Permanent rate as well as a 5Â¼ stamp length $1.80 strip with an additional trimmed extra). As well as being overlength, the 5Â¼ stamp $1.80 strip has badly mis-aligned printing, with one stamp missing the 14 digit code, another missing the $1.80 and a third stamp with a compressed double $1.80! The strip of 6 Permanent stamps is missing the computer-generated printing completely on the second stamp from the bottom of the strip. Other error strips (most much less impressive than these) from this series occasionally appear online at crazy prices. These are "must-have" items for any serious modern error collector and are impossible for fake. Estimate =	$250.00	$280.00
5614
136	Canada #F1a. Perfectly centered and fresh VF+ mint left-hand sheet margin example of a particularly bright vermilion shade of the 1875 issue 2c Registration stamp. Barest trace of minor disturbance on otherwise pristine full OG noted. Unitrade is $250.00 for VF mint Hinged. Tiny natural inclusion at lower left noted for the record. 2023 Scott US$185.00=	$249.75	$260.00
4247
137	Canada #F2b. A wonderfully deep, fresh and rich shade of the 1888 deep blue green printing of the 5c Registration stamp. Fine centered, mint no gum. 2023 Scott US$155.00=	$209.25	$50.00
5869
138	Canada #F3. Sound and Fine mint no gum example of the 1876 issue 8c dull blue Registration stamp. Note a small portion of the marginal plate inscription at lower right (which means that technically you could determine the plate position of this stamp). 2023 Scott US$675.00=	$911.25	$140.00
5983
139	Canada #FWH1-FWH25, FWH27-FWH37. Superb condition and intact run of 1985 to 2020 (inclusive) Federal Wildlife Conservation "Duck" stamps in choice mint condition complete booklets. Each pane is a miniature masterpiece of Canadian wildlife art, painted by various famous wildlife artists. The total face value of all booklets is $308.00. The more recent booklets are getting hard to find. 2023 Unitrade =	$1,025.00	$190.00
5614
140	Canada #J1c. Vibrantly fresh and VF mint NH part inscription sheet margin block of four of a particularly rich example of the distinctive 1928 printing "reddish violet" shade of the "first issue" 1c Postage due. 2023 Unitrade =	$320.00	$65.00
269
141	Canada #J6-J9. Vibrantly fresh and F/VF (lots of VF stamps) mint NH blocks of four of the 1c, 2c, 4c and 5c values from the 1930-1932 "second" postage due series. 2023 Scott Classic US$456.00=	$615.60	$60.00

The group includes the elusive smaller format 1972 & 1973 books (both with the stamps in black mounts affixed to the pages) and the rare larger format 1974 book (no punch-holes and with a sound binding, all the stamps neatly Hinged on the pages).

154	Canada - Collection in 4 Volumes. Used assemblage of used Classic and Modern Canada collectiion in 4 Unity albums covering the years 1870 (Small Queens) to 2000. The earlies tend to be "samplers" of various sets but it becomes more comprehensive as the years become more recent. A useful range of material and getting four albums with an apparently complete set of pages at once is a boon (the retail price for four Unity albums with pages and slipcovers is well over $200.00). Estimate =	$150.00	$60.00

We noted a couple of the books have a handful of Latvian stamps which can easily be removed (or perhaps spark a new collecting area!).

The consignor has semi-identified and valued a portion of the lot at over $2,200.00 retail. Mint modern Yugoslavia is not material that can usually be found in any quantity and rarely this nicely balanced for range and duplication! Estimate =	$550.00	$130.00

The collection is all mounted on mixed Jarrett and Unity printed album pages as well as one blank pages.

Pay for the postage and get the used stamps (as well as the "Back of the Book" material) for free! Total face value =	$533.83	$250.00
6455
182	Canada - Collection in Unity album, with pages to 1994 including "Back of the Book". While sparse in the early pages, this album starts to fill-up nicely once it hits the 1970's with a fairly comprehensive run of material from 1978-1994. A mix of both Mint and Used, with mostly used for the earlier issues, before shifting to Mint material in the more modern era. The album itself is in great condition. Conservatively valued for the value of the useable MINT material only. Total Face Value =	$304.06	$110.00
6301

The catalogue value would add up quickly on this one. Estimate =	$180.00	$60.00
6255

Pristine lot of Quarterly Packs complete for the years 2000-2005, sealed and with all of the issues including many sought-after die cut singles as well as blocks and souvenir sheets.

Total face value =	$155.93	$120.00
3740
186	Canada - Lunar New Years 1997-2008 dealer's hoard of 84 Thematic collections, featuring Canadian souvenir sheets in conjunction with the joint-issues of China and Hong Kong inside a special presentation folio. These packs sold for $9.95 / $12.95 as new from the Post Office at the time of issue and were always popular for their multi-faceted appeal. Most of the packs are still sealed in the original wrapper, with only a small percentage of them having been removed or "3-hole punched" as many collectors did to suit their albums. While the Unitrade catalogue values these packs at roughly twice the issue price, we have conservatively counted them at original retail only. Total original retail price from the Post Office =	$966.70	$190.00
6039
187	Canada - Lunar New Years 1997-2008. Complete run of 12 Canada Post issued Thematic Collections for the triple "Joint Issue" packs issued with Canada, Hong Kong and China issued lunar new years stamps / souvenir sheets for each year.

A lightly duplicated group QV to QEII, mostly hinged in the earlier material (QV, GeoV, GeoVI) and then never-hinged for the Elizabethan material. While the catalogue value would add up quickly, we have valued this lot by just adding up the total useable mint postage only. Total Face Value =	$121.25	$70.00
5977
190	Canada - Mint NH stock of 700 PLUS stamps 1897-1963 sorted in a stockbook. All are Never-Hinged, VG-VF, with most F-VF. NO common 1950's-1960's commemoratives in the lot.

These collector packs containing the mint NH stamps, souvenir sheets and booklets have recently been listed in Unitrade catalogue.

Conservatively valued at the original face value (not accounting for the increase in "P" value stamps. Total Face value =	$228.14	$160.00
6301
192	Canada - Small Queens to late 1980's collector's used accumulation, all neatly organized in glassines within 7 small boxes (filling up two large boxes for mailing). Many thousands of stamps here, totally unchecked for postmarks, precancels etc with good opportunity for variety hunting in the QEII material (we noted several packets of the mid-value Mammal issues).

Overlooked by most collectors who bought the heavily promoted coffee table souvenir book and the more readily available stamp panes of four. Each "keepsake" collection catalogues $22.50 in Unitrade.

5456
197	Canada - Thematic Collections 1973-1989 Dealer Stock. File-drawer, filled with 130 (duplicated, with a range of 1-22 of each) Post Office issued Thematic Collections. These collections have become increasingly desirable over the past decade as Canadian collectors endeavor to check off these "back of the book" items, as all listed in the back section of the Unitrade catalogue. The total face value of useable postage alone is $171.85, but worth more intact. 2023 Unitrade =	$779.00	$55.00
5979
198	Canada - Thematic Collections. A group of 37 different Post Office issued Thematic Collections 1971-1999, neatly packed into a small box.

6012

Mint and used collection of over 5,200 stamps and souvenir sheets, 1859 to 2013 period issues, with over 5,200 almost all different stamps in total, all housed in a three volume set of Harris Canada albums. While the condition is a bit mixed (expect some faults, especially in the earlies), the range and general comprehensiveness is quite decent. Much of the catalogue value is in the 19th and early 20th century issues, including decent "First Cents", Large and Small Queens, Jubilees, Leafs, Numerals and Edwards, including a 1908 Tercentenary set. While the older portions of this collection are almost all used, the section covering the 1970s and up has a noticeable mint component. The various "Back of the Book" issues are also well represented. Take a good look at the scans of the earlier pages to help you determine overall condition and comprehensiveness. A very useful basis for expansion! Owner's 2022 Scott US$8,238.45=	$11,121.90	$625.00

222	Canada Covers - British Columbia. BNAPEX 2010 Victoria BC. A collector inspired group of 34 covers, specially prepared to commemorate the BNAPS stamp show he attended, held in Victoria BC in the summer of 2010.

Of particular note are the covers which bear QV issued stamps and a group of 23 postal stationery envelopes, specially printed for the stamp show. An interesting group. Estimate =	$120.00	$34.00

This "The Story of Canada" collection consists of 84 different gold foil cacheted FDCs, all mounted on a full colour illustrated page with a story on the event being commemorated, along with a VF mint NH Canadian (or Newfoundland) stamp also associated with the event. Not a complete run of all the covers, as many of the subscribers ended the acquisition of these pricey items ($9.95 each for an original cost for this lot of $835.70) as the cost became excessive. Still a great collection for the fan of Canadian history and scarce cachet types for the FDC cachet collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$60.00
6012

A total of 3353 covers, lightly duplicated thorough but including many examples of matched set plate blocks in addition to "single" stamp examples. Largely complete for the period, the previous owner spent a considerable amount of time and money to purchase and arrange these chronologically by year. A real treasure trove for the FDC enthusiast. Total face value alone is $5105.56, which is less than the actual original retail cost of these from Canada Post as FDC are sold at a premium! Estimate =	$1,000.00	$500.00
5979
227	Canada Covers - First Day Covers accumulation 1960's-1990's of 507 covers, primarily with Canada Post issued cachets with many blocks / plate blocks, most individually sleeved and organized within a small box. A very clean lot, which the face-value alone adds up significantly considering the average postal rate during this period. Conservatively valued at the face value of the stamps alone, with the original cost from the post office being considerably higher. Total Face Value =	$338.33	$80.00
5979

A nice glimpse into the hey-day Canadian airmail during the late 1920's to the 1940's including some better usages, but also some of the more "modern" flights which can prove to be more elusive as there were only small batches flown. We noted a couple of Cherry Red Airline semi-official covers, a Northern Air Serivce semi-official cover (pilot signed) and a few dozen of the covers with either the better C2 or C4 stamp franking. Estimate =	$250.00	$260.00
5979

These were all created as one-of-a-kind items, purely for the collector, who was (whether he realized it or not) preserving the history of the Post Office during that period. Some pages have foxing from storage, although the covers and photographs appear to be fine. You can imagine the time and cost it would take to produce this! Estimate =	$280.00	$140.00

Some of the pages have foxing on them from storage, although the covers and photographs look fine. A labour of love went into these, when you consider the time / gasoline / photo-development cost. Estimate =	$120.00	$65.00
6468
232	Canada Covers - Postcard grouping of Northern BC / Yukon. An attractive grouping, housed in a Unitrade postcard album (with slipcase) with 56 postcards, mostly RPPC (real photo postcards) of Atlin, Dawson Creek, Alaska Highway Construction, Lake Bennett and Hazelton. Many better cards throughout, some in mixed-condition, but this represents a tough area to acquire multiple postcards. Many are priced on the back from when originally purchased (with prices to $50.00 per card, but most in the $5-$20 range). A nice chance to acquire a group of Northern postcards, housed in a premium album. Estimate =	$130.00	$75.00

A wonderful grouping, both visually appealing and a nice reference for future additions. A few faults as to be expected, but overall a very clean group. Although many of these would qualify for the Scott listed premium for centering / postmark, we have valued these as basic stamps only (lots of upside to this lot). 2022 Scott US$3020.00 =	$4,077.00	$220.00

6227
331	Liberia #3188-3190. Complete set of three "extreme high value" 2017 Animal definitive issues in Mint Never-Hinged sheets of 50. The designs feature Nile Crocodile ($4000 value), Red River Hog ($6000 value) and the Leopard ($10,000 value). At today's exchange rate from the Liberian dollar to Canadian dollar, these sheets would represent over $8200.00 CDN face value. The Scott catalogue on these is US$430.00 per set (and you have 50 sets here). 2023 Scott US$21,500 =	$29,025.00	$375.00
6025
332	Macao #75/1486. Lovely balance of collection of the former Portuguese territory now an administrative region of China, from a smattering of used early issues to MNH sets and S/S as recent as 2016 as well as some Back of the Book material. Includes several new issue announcement folders from the Macanese post office. Some light duplication noted, a rigorous sort will prove very worthwhile. 2022 Scott US$1037.00 =	$1,399.95	$260.00

333	Malaya / Thai Occupation #2N1-2N6. Mint no-gum, complete set of 6 of the 1943 "War Memorial" series, issued under Thai occupation for use in Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Trengganu.

336	New Zealand #136c. VF mint NEVER HINGED vertical pair of the 1909-1916 issue 5p red brown Edward with the rare mixed 14 x 13½ and 14 x 14½ perf types. Scott doesn't have a NH price for this variety but all the references I could find (including Campbell-Paterson) give a 200% premium for NH. Scott Catalogue as Hinged US$200.00 =	$270.00	$75.00
5103
337	New Zealand #B3-B4. Fresh, VF and mint NH complete 1931 issue "Laughing Boy" semi-postal set of two. These are the best known and most valuable of all the NZ semi-postals. 2023 Scott US$500.00=	$675.00	$160.00

The #3 is likely a fake as it is on old and likely handmade but not laid pinkish paper. All of the other earlies are genuine. A good start to the earlier issues of this historically rich eastern European country. Owner's 2019 Scott $462.95=	$624.98	$55.00

These sections have Scott catalogue values of $485.40, $144.55 and $267.10, respectively. Interestingly, the postage for each shipment of new issues was covered by including CTO NH stamps within rather than on the outside of the envelopes. Rounded out with a few "Miniature World" post office publications. 2022 Scott US$897.05 =	$1,211.02	$280.00
5435
346	Somali Coast and Oblock - Selection of 59 Mint and Used 1892-1966 arranged on a stocksheet. A nice array of issues which don't come up too often. Expect a few minor faults, but overall a very clean offering. Owner's older 2013 Scott US$542.35 =	$732.17	$140.00

349	Switzerland #41-68. Duplicated specialized grouping of 85 stamps, both Mint and Used from 1862-1881 period "Seated Helvetia" issues, still organized by the original collector on his page. All stamps counted a the basic Scott valuation, although there is plenty of upside since many of the sub-listed shades are here (many which catalogue substantially more). Condition seems to be fairly good for these issues, with the exception of one trimmed stamp (not counted in the total). 2022 Scott US$2041.95 =	$2,756.63	$220.00
6395

3795
356	USA #C1/C32, E12, E14. All mint Hinged selection of 23 different Air Mails and two Special Delivery issues. Except for the very lack of expensive Zeppelins, the Air Mails are usefully comprehensive and in very decent condition. 2023 Scott US$311.25=	$420.19	$44.00
5016
357	USA #PR57/PR125. Mixed condition selection of 13 lightly duplicated 1870s to 1890s issue Newspaper stamps, all laid out on one Hagner stocksheet. The #PR83 is used but all the others are OG H/HR.

6447
358	USA #WX5. Full sheet of 100 of the 1909 American Red Cross issued Christmas Seal, designed by Carl Wingate and printed by lithography be The Strobridge Co, Cincinnati Ohio. Intact sheets of these early Christmas Seals are getting exceedingly tough to find. A few spots of separation noted with a few hinge-reinforcements on the reverse, but well above average for sheets from this period. Catalogued as WX5 in the Scott USA Specialized catalogue at $1.25 per stamp but worth much more as a intact sheet. We only found one other intact sheet for sale online, offered at US$349.00 ($470.00 Canadian). Estimate =	$150.00	$34.00
6025

The third and last portion is a small box with a couple thousand un-sorted precancels. An interesting large group, needing a sort, offered as received by us. Estimate =	$250.00	$110.00
5435
362	USA - Revenue Hoard. Manila Envelope filled with a wide-array of unchecked United States (plus a few WW) revenue stamp and "back of the book" material. We noted Rations, Documentary stamps, Officially Sealed, Stock-Transfer, Tobacco, Thrift stamps, Wine Labels, coil issue "Test" stamps, Liquor revenues, postage due and special delivery (to name a few). A very interesting and diverse offering, sure to be some treasures for the ardent philatelist to search out. Estimate =	$150.00	$210.00
5055

4236
364	USA - Small box stuffed with US material as accumulated by a collector of Canada (as opposed to a Canadian collector), which means that better material is bound to be found throughout as this material was seemingly added to the box as received over the years. We noted a handful of covers, mint, used, precancels, postage dues, WWII rations, stationery cut-squares, parcel-post and plate blocks including C22 plate number block of six. Estimate =	$200.00	$220.00
269

Estimate =	$150.00	$140.00
6025

Although most of the material appears to catalogue $5 and under, there is a smattering of better items throughout. The sheer quantity of material here is staggering when you start to look at it. Duplicated in spots and condition varies - but a nice chance to acquire a large worldwide stock, ready to check against what you have, or take to the local clubs / shows.

375	Worldwide EUROPA - Europa Collection 1956-2019. An extensive MINT collection of Europa (by far, the most complete we have seen in some time) arranged within four deluxe Lighthouse brand albums (with slipcases) on computer generated pages. A total of 3932 stamps and 240 souvenir sheets, complete for the 1956-2004 period and then about 80% complete thereafter. Unfortunately, the stamps have been heavily hinged, causing most of them to be stuck in the albums. We catalogued Volume 1 (1956-1979) and came out with a catalogue value of over US$2000.00, with the following albums likely along the same line in terms of catalogue value. The previous owner states that over $6000 was spent on putting this collection together, often one set at a time purchased from European dealers as the material can be tough to find in Canada. Also, note a couple of the albums are in need of repair, with the spine coming dislodged from the jacket. A nice chance to acquire largely complete Europa collection. Estimate =	$850.00	$475.00

4612
5	Antigua / Barbuda #16/1880. Box with a couple hundred 102 cards holding a dealer's stock. Starts off in the classic periods, which is a bit sparse, but saw some value in the "Seal of the Colony" issue with both mint and used. The strength in the stock is in the late 1960’s to the mid-1980’s, with large numbers of sets and singles, all appear to be mint never hinged, with up to 10 copies of each set. There is lots of topical interest including airplanes, animals, flowers and Royals. Catalogued by previous owner, at an unknown date, but a quick check indicated that it wasn’t too far off.

269

A huge array of topical interest in there with ships, butterflies, Christmas, comics, shells and wildlife (to name a few). Note, the original Post Office price was often more than the face value of the stamps included. The Australia alone has a face value of AUD$107.90. Estimate =	$120.00	$95.00
1315
12	Australia and New Zealand - Carton contains 4 binders of Australia and 2 binders of New Zealand collections, dealer stocks, and covers, mostly from 1900-2000. The Australia has ‘Roos up to the 2/- and KGV Heads to the 4d, with some possible cancel interest (unchecked by us for watermark). While most of the material is used, we did see a set of the first Australian Antarctic Territory issue in MNH blocks (L1-7, Scott US$52.00). Finishes with a binder of 180 Australia to Canada covers mostly from the 1980s-90s, which are starting to gain appreciation overseas because of the many short-term rates. The New Zealand includes some potential value from the officials, saw a lovely 9d KGV official overprint in a used block, one stamp damaged, but the three remaining stamps cat US$120.00. Estimate =	$200.00	$180.00

The postage value of the more modern material adds up quickly. The back of the book is well represented, with a couple hundred stamps covering postage dues, newspapers and scatterings in several other areas. The collection is housed in a Davo regular album with pages to 1992 and slipcase. 2021 Scott US$1451.00 =	$1,959.00	$190.00
6014
15	Austria #3/950 plus BOB. A thorough collection housed in a Minkus album up to about 1973. The earlier issues were selected for nice cancels. 1890’s onward are fairly complete for the basic issues, missing out only the better values. The collector was in the process of upgrading the collection and a number of glassine envelopes are tucked into the fold, which may prove fruitful. Over 1700 stamps are included here, including significant amounts of semi-postals, postage dues, newspaper stamps, as well as issues for the Levant, Bohemia & Moravia, Romania. 2021 Scott US$1728.00 =	$2,332.80	$290.00

Lots of pictorial, omnibus and commemorative sets. Noted small thin on #134 (cat .40c), otherwise all the others are sound and attractive. 2023 Scott US$332.80=	$449.28	$100.00
5016

163
23	British Commonwealth - Coronation Omnibus Set Duo. VF, all mint (H and NH mix) omnibus sets for the 1937 GeoVI Coronation and the 1953 QEII Coronation.

All mounted on printed album pages. All housed in a top-of-the-line Unisafe binder with matching slipcase. 2023 Scott US$294.65=	$387.78	$55.00

30	British East Africa #14/103. Victorian-era eye candy from this East African territory before it merged with Uganda and before it became known as Kenya. A quick glance shows that there are different shades and printings to be found here, as well as some potential for interesting cancels. A combination of mint and used (with duplication). The four highest value stamps all have issues including #49, which has a tear in the upper right corner (we haven’t counted this stamp at all), #86 might be a revenue cancel (Cat $85.) and the two larger QV issues, while appearing to be postally used have faults that are more apparent from the back than the front (cat $200.00, so left in the lot). Still lots to work with here in the sound material. 2023 Scott US$648.05 =	$874.85	$42.00
5993
31	British Honduras #8/268, J1-3, MR4. Combination of TWO mounted collections of 160 mint and used stamps, which nicely complement each other, resulting in almost no duplication. Strength is in QV overprints and QV-KGV definitives with values up to the dollar. Condition is good, but the mint stamps tend to be a bit heavily hinged. 2023 Scott US$983.30 =	$1,327.46	$170.00
4741
32	British Indian Ocean Territory #1/386.

Offered as received, includes four pages of individual stamps and 6 large blocks/partial sheets. All stamps are used, some presumably cancelled to order.

A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$55.00
5492
88	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c values for the 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist.

Verified and listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Historically the sheet has sold at (or even above) the (just priced in 2023 edition) 2023 Unitrade =	$275.00	$130.00
6442
91	Canada #2844. Rare VF MNH complete souvenir sheet of 5 of the quickly recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Canada showing an image of "Hoodoos" instead of Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta on the first $1.20 stamp.

6035
92	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 20 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2023 Unitrade =	$1,000.00	$85.00

A 20+ year collection in the making featuring a fairly complete run of issues for the period, usually with a FDC and inscription block for each issue. Mounted within 5 photo-albums, the Mint NH stamps come out easily, but some of the FDC need to be carefully removed as these photo-albums were never intended to contain philatelic material.

An interesting and unusual lot of 315 First Day Covers, dated 2003-2006, each bearing an unusual "modern" illustrated cachet and being cancelled from around the province of BC (with some Alberta too). The postmarks in this group are quite interesting, as the collector made a point of travelling to all-ends of the province to acquire postmarks from as many different BC post offices as he could (for example, the 2004 "Pets" issue, which has all the FDC cancelled at different areas of the Okanagan region, which means he would have travelled between those post offices on that day). A huge variety of postmarks, including many "modern" offices which were often only open for a short-period. These are totally unchecked and "one of a kind" as they were made by the collector for his own collection. Estimate =	$200.00	$230.00

Estimate =	$300.00	$270.00
6128
149	Canada Covers - First Day Covers. Small box filled with 391 covers 1960's to 1980's with a mix of both Canada Post issued cachet FDC and privatively produced cachet FDC.

5979
152	Canada Covers - Military / Canadian Forces. Small box containing 290 covers and 17 pieces / stamps featuring postmarks and postal history of the Canadian Forces from WWII to Modern (including Afghanistan conflict). A diverse offering including WWII Overseas, RCAF in Canada / Newfoundland and overseas, illustrated cigarette cards, training stations / MPO postmarks, Field Post Offices, Somalia UN Forces, blackout cancels and auxiliary markings. A nice lot for any collector of Canadian Military postal history or show / internet dealer to break apart to sell individually.

Many still mounted on the original home-made album pages done decades ago. Noted several areas of interest including ship mail, northern outposts, weather stations, town cancels, special occasion / commemorative covers and a variety of postmark types. An enticing large lot of Northern material, being offered as received. Estimate =	$250.00	$280.00
6150
155	Canada Covers - Nova Scotia MOON cancels. Between 1960-1962, collector Reg Piggott of Kentville NS sent out letters to postmasters asking for favour covers to be returned to him with the stamp tied by the post office’s current rubber cancel. Not much is known about this effort, including how many sets he sent out (although it is probably less than 50 of each) or how many constitute a complete holding. Over 85% of the returned items had a MOON cancel and for many of these hammers, these are the only way to obtain an example. Many of these small town post offices are now closed. This lot is considered to be complete, or very close. A total of 252 different post offices are represented. All on #8 covers, with a rubber stamp address back to Mr. Piggott. A tough lot to assemble, conservatively estimated at only 60c per cover. Estimate =	$160.00	$110.00
3619
156	Canada Covers - Official Mail "OHMS" or "G" overprint issues on cover. Small box containing 100 covers from the post-WWII GeoVI era, all being Official Mail with the "Back of the Book" overprints (but noted a few OHMS perfins too, some used in conjunction with the Official OVPT stamps). A nice study of rates and usages here, with the majority of the covers being addressed to the RCMP Police in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Larger lots of official mail are getting tougher to find. Estimate =	$120.00	$150.00
4638
157	Canada Covers - Ontario / QV to QEII (mostly) Era Postal History. Small box STUFFED with 775 covers and 24 pieces, all selected for (primarily) Ontario postmarks with hundreds of them being either Registered or Special Delivery covers (an attractive QEII rate study in itself). Also noticed a small amount of "other provinces" and earlier material. Noted TONS of variety in there including Advertising, Postage Due, Rates, Slogans, Postal Stationery and "Return to Sender". A great lot for the cancel / rate collector or show / internet dealer to break apart. Estimate =	$200.00	$575.00
4638
158	Canada Covers - P1/P294. Postal Stationery post cards, spanning 1871-1985 with a wide range of card sizes, printings, papers, dies and often mint and used copies of each. The items, including the duplicates, are housed in 2 and 4 pocket pages, and we didn’t take them out to check for any interesting printed-backs or cancels. The best are the selection of KGV mint reply cards. Saw items with individual Webb catalogue values of $15.00 each. Usual minor faults to be expected, but a nice place to start your Canadian postal card collection. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3333
159	Canada Covers - Post Card Factory and Canada Post pre-paid postal stationery view cards from 1990’s-2000’s. A variety of issues here including Commemoratives, Tourism, Lunar New Year, and a selection of the hard-to-find cards that can only be purchased through local sellers, usually in the regions depicted. One of the emerging issues with these post cards is that because the value is tied to the International letter rate, currently $2.71 each, the cost of buying cards has significantly hampered collector purchases, and almost eliminated dealers from buying. Collectors who are trying to find these cards, to supplement stamp issues, for topical purposes, or just for completeness, are having a hard time finding them. This lot has 120 mint items (Face Value $325.00) as well as a dozen cancelled-to-order cards sent by the collector to himself. Used cards are much harder to find than mint. Estimate =	$150.00	$150.00
5614

Most 1890’s and all used, the vast majority with printed backs from Ontario banks, including Ontario Bank, Imperial, Standard, often with the small originating town printed as part of the form. There might be some cancel interest lurking here too, we saw several Strachan Avenue /Toronto CDS cancels. There are easily 1500 cards in this lot, and the condition is better than usual, but some brittleness and aging can be expected. A goldmine for the banking collector! Estimate =	$300.00	$160.00
2189
162	Canada Covers - Saskatchewan Post Office collection. A collector's project of collecting images (photographs) of the Post Office during the late 1980's / early 1990's, accompanied by a cover postmarked at the same location. Banker's box containing 8 binders, which feature 114 covers and 99 photographs from a wide array of both city and rural Post Offices, neatly arranged by postal code with most pages featuring one cover and one photograph to showcase the Post Office. These were all created as one-of-a-kind items, purely for the collector, who was (whether he realized it or not) preserving the history of the Post Office during that period. Some pages have foxing from storage, although the covers and photographs appear to be fine. You can imagine the time and cost it would take to produce this! Estimate =	$120.00	$150.00
3651
163	Canada Covers - Small Queen Cover Hoard. A selection of 219 covers and 9 pieces, put together by a collector decades ago to show a range of Small Queen stamp usages. Although many of these covers have faults, the stamps alone present a great opportunity for shades / perforations / varieties as most appear to be totally unchecked. A great lot for study. Estimate =	$150.00	$240.00
3587
164	Canada Precancels - City Type Selection. Almost all different selection of various EdwardVII, GeoV and GeoVI period "city" type precancels (17 different cities).

An old-school Minkus album contains a good starter collection of mint and used issues, including a number that the previous collector had bought and hadn’t got around to mounting.

Includes a selection of mint and used, some duplicates and a number of better used items up to 1R face value (Scott catalogue values of $65.00 each). This may be a fine opportunity for the specialist to make some finds, as we have not checked out the obvious printing differences that are here and have just used the lowest value from Scott. A couple of the lower denomination stamps with obvious revenue cancels were not counted. Speaking of revenue cancels, check out the dozen large, mostly Edwardian, high denomination stamps (up to 20R). As postally used, these would catalogue over $3200.00 but these will hold a place in your collection until legitimately used copies come along (not counted at all in the total catalogue value). For the non-revenue cancelled items, total 2023 Scott US$790.50 =	$1,067.10	$110.00

2712
198	Finland #4/238 plus Back of the book. A fine collection of 300 mostly used stamps mounted on homemade pages. It starts off strong with the early serpentine roulette issues with very few perfs missing. Saw #57 & #58 (looking good, but both offered as-is), lots of semi-postals, C1. A terrific and remarkably complete collection that hasn’t been looked at in a generation. 2023 Scott US$3517.00 =	$4,747.95	$600.00
3961
199	France #1/Recent including Back of the Book.

6200
284	Italy - Folder containing several "bits and bobs" from older Italian collections, but don’t let the packaging fool you.

4389
285	Jamaica #1/152, B1-B3. Mint and used selection of 106 lightly duplicated (usually for mint and used) 1860-1952 period issues, including definitives, commemoratives and semi-postals.

4389
290	Latvia #1/307 plus Back of the Book. Fairly complete pre-war mounted collection of 400+ mint and used stamps. Includes many sets with both perforated and imperforated stamps, including many semi-postals, air mails and semi-postal airmails. Where there is duplication, it is because there is a mint and used example. A rough check of the mint stamps indicated that most are hinged, so there is no premium for the never hinged examples. A lovely clean lot. 2023 Scott US$1650.00 =	$2,227.50	$375.00
6227
291	Latvia #7/130 plus Back of the Book. Dealer's stock of Latvian issues, neatly housed and identified by Michel catalogue in "102" cards arranged by catalogue number with a dealer "Red Box". Several hundred stamps, with Michel value to 20 Euros, but most appear to be under 4 Euros or less. Still, the shear quantity here would make the catalogue value add up quickly. These never saw any online or show sales (so not picked over), arranged in the box and then placed on the shelf for a future date. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
5691

The duplicate material from this period (no QV) is housed on a number of 102 cards. Lots of Omnibus issues here. This lot is being offered as received, and we haven’t checked for colours, papers etc, so plenty of up-side for the savvy collector. 2023 Scott US$439.70 =	$593.60	$70.00
4389
293	Leeward Islands #103-115. Complete King George VI keystone set, remarkably fresh, well centered copies. All are hinged, with a couple having minor hinge remnants. We have not checked these stamps for perfs, colours or papers. So potentially some up-side for the specialist. We note that a variety of gum colours, which indicate that this set was put together over time, so there may be a find or two here. As a basic set, 2023 Scott US$149.45 =	$201.75	$55.00
5241
294	Lesotho #1/1121. Round out your Southern African collection with this 32-page Scott stockbook filled with stamps from the former Basutoland, starting with overprinted issues and running until the late 1990’s. The majority of the value is in mint issues, with only a few of the earlier being hinged, the balance never hinged, including some of the difficult sets to find from the 1970’s. The more modern material has a significant topical appeal, with animals, butterflies, sports themes (including a number of attractive souvenir sheets). 2023 Scott US$395.00 =	$533.25	$60.00
5435
295	Luxembourg #53/1108. Red 32-page stockbook containing a solid accumulation of about 1000 mint and used stamps.

Estimate =	$150.00	$75.00
5474

Total catalogue value of this half US$325.30. The second part of the offering is about 70 stamps in VF MNH sets and souvenir sheets, untouched since being received as new issues between 1994-1998. These modern issues catalogue US$189.45. Total 2023 Scott US$514.75 =	$694.91	$90.00
6227
297	Malaya Kelantan - All mint and mostly Never Hinged selection of 50 different 1928 to 1963 period issues, including fresh and VF complete sets.

2299
298	Malayan States / Japanese Occupation - Stockbook with a mini-hoard of several hundred mint stamps, with a range of overprints applied during the Japanese occupation in WWII. Included are revaluations, different colour overprints, and larger blocks to allow for plating with the occasional plate number seen in the salvage. Unchecked for minor printing variations in the overprints. The appearance of the stamps is generally good, but these items originated in a humid environment, and gum toning can be expected. A small sample indicates that many, but not all, of the stamps are never hinged with duplication of up to 45 examples of a single issue. Negri-Sembilan (catalogue $167.00), Pahang (catalogue $383.00), Perak (catalogue $173.00), Selangor (catalogue $158.00), Straits Settlements (catalogue $67.00). Total 2023 Scott US$948.00 =	$1,279.80	$120.00
6255
299	Mexico #2/1070 plus Airmail and other BOB. A fabulous old-time collection of classic Mexico, up to the early 1970s that hasn’t seen the light of day for a generation. Starts with a good selection of Hidalgo issues on different papers, overprinted and without overprints with some cancel interest. Over 900 stamps attests to how complete this collection is, which is neatly mounted on quadrilled pages, clearly identified by issue. There is a mix of mint and used stamps here, only limited duplication because there is one of each. The condition is well above average for this type of collection. Was catalogued by the previous owner, and a random check indicates that the value is correct. Owner’s total (older Scott) catalogue value US$2481.00 =	$3,349.25	$800.00
6311
300	Morocco #3/323 plus Back of the Book. An all mint H/NH collection (mostly complete sets) covering the period from 1891 to 1955.

2299
302	Netherlands #1/1378. This collection of about 1450 stamps, covers Dutch issues from the early days up until 2002. As normal, the first issues are used, but nice and clean. The collection moves into a combination of mint and used issues. Later issues include sheetlets and souvenir sheets. The collection catalogues about US$2000.00. A quick tally of the modern issues indicates a face value of over $300 (Canadian $ equivalent). Pages run up to 2014 but are very sparsely filled after 2002. Estimate =	$400.00	$140.00
4389
303	Netherlands #2/1200 plus lots of BOB. UNIE 2 volume hingeless album, with pages to 2005, hosts this lovely 2600 stamp collection. The collection starts off used, and becomes mixed mint (hinged) and used by the 1930’s, before reverting to mostly used in the 1970’s. Both binders have a bit of wear to bottom edge. 2021 Scott US$1840.00 =	$2,484.00	$120.00
5984
304	Netherlands #B1/B761 plus bit of other BOB. A large album dedicated to semi-postal issues of Holland, which starts from the first issue (1906 anti-Tuberculosis). The 829 stamps represent a fairly complete collection of these popular issues. The early issues are used, then there is a mix of mint and used, with the mint being hinged in the earlier issues, then never hinged in the later issues. Good condition and lovingly presented. The Scott catalogue value for the semi-postals is US$1198.00 with some other back of the book issues also included (e.g. air mail, postage dues, officials). 2021 Scott US$1341.00 =	$1,810.35	$65.00
2299

The first book runs from Scott #4 up to #1147 and contains over 5,000 stamps. The second book runs from Scott #1148 up to recent and contains 1,933 stamps. A great lot for the show or internet dealer. Owner's total Scott $1,483.00=	$2,002.05	$80.00

306	Netherlands - Useful Mostly Used Stock of Semi-Postal Issues.

5817
307	New Zealand - Collector's accumulation of Mint and (mostly) Used stamps from early QV issues to the early 2000's, all containing within two stockbooks, several pages within a plastic container and a small box (filled with glassines / "102" cards). Lots of interesting in the early issue, with a range of values, unchecked for shades, varieties or postmarks. The later period provides a good showing of somewhat recent used, with many clean or unobtrusive postmarks. A great working lot. Estimate =	$150.00	$220.00
6311
308	New Zealand - Large binder with a strong offering of modern mint NH singles, sets and souvenir sheets (1973-2007), all mounted in clear mounts on homemade pages, each held in a page protector. The face value of the modern material is NZ$890.00 ($750.00 Canadian), but there is so much more to this lot including a collection of used stamps going back to the Victorian period (fairly complete after 1940), and many newer issues where a mint and used set was collected. These modern issues often catalogue as much used as they do mint. There are a few FDC’s with a total face value of around $100.00 and even two folded NZ Post souvenir posters, to round out this collection. Estimate =	$500.00	$190.00
4389
309	New Zealand - Mounted collection of 1000 mostly used stamps on assorted album pages in 3-ring binder covering 1874-1979. Early is a bit sparse, but did see #54, #69 w/ad printed on back, and a 2/- Milford sound with "Official" overprint, as well as C5, QEII 10/- horseback and additional strength in official overprints. There are also 26 mint and 6 used Health Souvenir Sheets. There is a bit of duplication as the collection is organized by Stanley Gibbons numbers and was collected for specialized perfs and printings (we did not check for accuracy), but there is potential unrealized value here. Estimate =	$350.00	$200.00
6311
310	North Borneo and Labuan #26/296. Selection of 350 mint and used stamps, 1880s-1962 scattered over several extracted album and stockbook pages. Includes the ever-popular animal issues with a myriad of overprints, including revalues and Labuan, and interesting favour cancellations. There is value in the more modern material including mint hinged complete sets of the first 2 QEII issues, which catalogue alone at $250.00 US. Overall condition looks pretty good. There is undoubtedly a bit of duplication. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3969
311	Nyasaland #112/118. Rare opportunity to acquire masses of the 1963 overprints on revenue stamps, in complete sheets of 60! The bulk is the 1/2d stamp with 120 sheets, but also the 1p (2 sheets), 2p (1 sheet), 9p (2 sheets), 1/- (2 sheets). A few partial sheets are not counted. All sheets all contain inscriptions and plate numbers at the bottom, and some have counting numbers in the upper right corner – no premium is attached to any of these. The bonus is that this lot comes with the original cardboard and label from Bradbury Wilkinson, and is housed in an unused, and slightly battered, large unused “On Her Majesty’s Service” envelope. Many of the sheets have paper interleaves, keeping the stamps and gum in great shape. Might be some minor damage to the selvedge here and there. Total Scott catalogue value over US$2000.00. Estimate =	$140.00	$75.00
4389
312	Nyasaland Protectorate #2/86. Eye catching page of 31 stamps, including many used with SON cancels, including #21 4/- KGV, and #27. A few mint examples are sprinkled in, and there is some minor duplication. Overall, the condition is very clean with the mint items being very lightly hinged, including the Royal Wedding high value. Items are generally unchecked for papers or colours, and catalogued as the basic 2023 Scott US$275.75 =	$372.25	$48.00
3612
313	Pacific Islands - An eclectic holding of mostly mint issues between 1920-85 from a range of British Commonwealth Islands, best is Tokelau, but there is worthwhile Niue, Cook Islands, Ross Dependency (L1-4 in NH blocks of 4), Samoa (#370-378C), Cocos, Fiji, New Guinea, Australia Antarctic Territory. Very clean, mostly hinged pre-1950. You get a sense of deja-vu viewing this lot, as the previous collector had some duplication (generally less than 4 of each) that appeared to be randomly mounted. Lot finishes with a bit of material from other countries, including a small Soccer topical holding. An attractive lot. Estimate =	$180.00	$65.00
269
314	Pakistan : Bahawalpur #1/29, O1/028. All mint H or used selection of 53 different stamps, 1947-1949 period, both regular and Official issues. Very nearly complete for the issues of this short-lived (an independent state, now part of Pakistan). Very elusive material. 2023 Scott US$396.15=	$534.80	$55.00
4877
315	Philippines - Dealer's red "102 card" box, about 75% filled with dealer cards filled with both Mint and Used material from the early Spanish colony issues (earliest is Scott #81) to 2001 including a good showing of "back of the book" material with semi-postal and airmail issues. A nice clean lot, not catalogued, but would add up quickly. Estimate =	$160.00	$120.00
6232
316	Poland General Government - Accumulation in a small shoe box, including mint and used and cancels on cover/card. Saw 60 assorted post cards with various commemorative cancels, including Mozart. Some duplication, but often with different cancels or franking. Also a group of 13 mint postal stationery post cards and envelopes. For the researcher, the lot contains hundreds of stamps in over 25 envelopes, including mint corner blocks and large blocks and used stamps in quantity. The used stamps may prove rewarding for the collector of postmarks. This holding hasn’t seen the light of day in years, unpicked by us. Offered as received. Estimate=	$180.00	$80.00
3969
317	Portugal #517/1837. Three-volume accumulation of mostly used stock housed on manila stocksheets. Includes some better including #531 & #532, 12 souvenir sheets and the 1936 Red Cross relief stamps in mint blocks. Some duplication, the previous owner had made a detailed tally of the catalogue value in 2013, which came out to over US$4,000. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
5984
318	Rhodesia - Cancel Study/Selection. Wide ranging selection of a few hundred 1970s period postmarks, mostly complete strikes on stamp on piece. Includes a number of the "mutilated" (S removed) postmarks from the Southern Rhodesia to Rhodesia transitional period. Great basis for expansion. Estimate =	$120.00	$10.00
4824
319	Rhodesia - Specialized Range of Railway Parcel Stamps. All mint NH selection of all different Rhodesian Railway stamps, neatly laid out on Hagner stock sheets. The group includes four undenominated imperforate proofs, two undenominated perforated proofs, eight decimal currency issues (1c to 50c) and 54 pre-decimal stamps (1d to £1). Each and every stamp in this lot is different, either for denomination, town code or Mardon/Waterlow printings. Research on Ebay only found scattered singles or random multiples on offer, no comprehensive groups such as this. The lot also includes useful information from older articles (1987/1988). A great kickstart to an exhibit of these railway post related issues. Estimate =	$150.00	$85.00
3634
320	Russia #149/3558 plus Extras. Collection of 1918-1968 issues, housed in a Scott Specialized album containing approximately 250 pages and over 3,000 stamps plus most of the souvenir sheets of the period. The stamps are mostly mint Hinged or CTO. An excellent basis for expansion. Estimate =	$500.00	$325.00
5028
321	Russia #3544/5218 plus Back of the Book. The second volume of the Russian collection, housed in Scott Specialty album containing 1969-1983 period issues and including many Back-of-the-Book items from earlier periods. Over 2,000 stamps and souvenir sheets in total, Hinged and in Hingeless mounts on about 200 pages. The stamps are mainly mint Hinged, mint NH or CTO. The collection is fairly complete from 1969 to 1979 but becomes a bit thin on later dates. The Semi-postal and Airmail section is useful. A very attractive and collectible group, neatly mounted on clean pages. Estimate =	$400.00	$325.00
5028
322	Saar and Post-WWII French Zone Occupations - Mint and used lightly duplicated 1920 to 1959 period selection/collection of Saar, both pre- and post-WWII period issues (#4/322, B105-B106, O1/O34) plus a range of French Zone issues consisting of: general issues (#4N1-4N13); Baden (5N1/5N33); Rheinland-Pfalz #6N1/6N36); and Wurttemburg (#8N1/8N34). All neatly laid out in one Lighthouse brand stockbook. 2022 Scott US$512.20=	$691.47	$100.00
5931
323	Saint Pierre and Miquelon - The "France Libre FNFL" WWII overprints. Six different denominations, including three revalued, in fresh, crisp half panes of 25. Stamps are very fine mint never hinged. A few perf separations are noted, and there is some minor damage to the selvedge, which does not detract from this lovely offering. Perfect to study overprint settings, or to break up for online sale. 2023 Scott US$2575.00 =	$3,476.25	$350.00
6363
324	Samoa #181/200. Almost all mint OG Hinged (#189 is used) selection of 18 different 1939 to 1950 period GeoVI issues. The best singles are the £1 pink and £2 violet overprinted postal fiscals. 2023 Scott Classic US$420.30=	$567.41	$55.00
4827
325	Sierra Leone #1/1792. Accumulation starting with a stockcard of 97 mostly used stamps from the classic early period, ranging from the first issue with QV issues up to 1/-, KEVII to 2 ½ d and finishing with a very lightly hinged #207 from the first Elizabethan issue. Total 2023 Scott catalogue value for this page is US$296.45 alone. The lot also has some more modern issues up until about 1995, including attractive issues with mushroom, dinosaur and the infamous Mars exploration set of six souvenir sheets. Estimate =	$130.00	$42.00
4389
326	South Africa - Mint and used collection of British Africa South Africa and Republic of South Africa 1/1283 & B1/C30 from 1910 to 2002. Many of the early bilingual se-tenant issues have been valued as the lowest price, knowledgeable scrutiny could give some pleasant surprises. 2021 Scott US$557.80 =	$753.03	$40.00
5983
327	Southern Nigeria #20 SPECIMEN. Exceptionally fresh and Fine OG Hinged example of the 1903 issue £1 purple and grey green Edward VII high value with "SPECIMEN" overprint. Light horizontal handling bend at bottom noted for the record. Scott catalogue for a regular #20 is US$475.00=$641.25 CDN. Estimate =	$200.00	$24.00
6157
328	Sweden #17/410 plus back of the book. A good collection of Sweden’s first 75 years issuing stamps, mounted on homemade album pages. This mostly used collection includes some better values such as Scott #18, 21, 27, 37 (some short perfs at bottom), both 1924 UPU sets up to the 5K, and lots of semi-postals. Besides the basic catalogue value, this collection was assembled with an eye for printings not listed in Scott (but often annotated on the album under the stamp, which could include types and shade differences). There is significant cancel potential, particularly in the earlier years. Condition appears to be far better than average. Total catalogue value = US$2700.00 =	$3,645.00	$200.00
5295
329	Sweden #39/2408a. Two three-ring binders, with 49 manila stocksheets, stuffed with a few thousand used stamps (and a few mint, for the record). Would make for a good collection builder, might be some cancel interest. A nice lot for the Swedish enthusiast. Estimate =	$140.00	$55.00
4466
330	Sweden #1623/2425. A nice modern offering of Swedish stamps covering almost 700 stamps and 30 booklet panes issued between 1987-2002, housed in green padded 2 post Lighthouse album with hingeless pages (album retails $400.00 alone). Catalogued back in 2013 at US$1673.00, which still holds up well. The mint stamps have a face value of 3800.00 SKR (over $500.00 CDN equivalent). Estimate =	$400.00	$290.00
4466
331	Sweden #O1/O55. Very attractive lot of used Swedish official stamps was put together by a collector who loved stamps with eye appeal. Near complete, missing only O7 & O9, with examples shade differences, and a number with Socked-on-the-nose cancels. You will wait a long time before seeing as nice a holding of these issues. There are a couple of glassine envelopes with duplicates and a page of postage dues which are not included in the total catalogue value. 2023 Scott US$889.00 =	$1,200.15	$65.00
3613
332	Sweden and Norway - Strength is in Sweden (1000 stamps) beginning in the 1880s. The Norway (600 stamps) starting in the 1940’s. Almost exclusively used and mounted in a Minkus album with pages up to 1984. The lot includes the Minkus pages for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, but there are only a handful of stamps from the Baltic areas. Estimate =	$100.00	$65.00
6466
333	Switzerland #41/486 plus semi-postals and other BOB. An outstanding collection of entirely used stamps nicely mounted on Minkus pages, that hasn’t seen the light of day for over 50 years! Starts strongly with the Seated Helvetia issue, a good coverage of the William Tell issues, very complete Pro-Juventute issues. The 1945 PAX issue is only missing the 5fr value. But above this, is the level of quality that the previous owner of this collection had. Cancels are clean, the stamps are fresh and the eye-appeal is strong. There aren’t many collections that can complete with this. 2023 Scott US$4264.30 =	$5,756.81	$240.00
2299
334	Switzerland #43 / 638b. Attractive used selection of 142 different used stamps 1862-1984 neatly arranged on small-size stockpages including earlier issues and a tete-beche pair. Most (if not all) bear CDS cancels, making this a choice grouping for the "used" stamp collector. 2022 Scott US$373.60 =	$504.36	$28.00
3613
335	Switzerland #43/746 plus BOB. An uncharacteristically haphazard offering of Switzerland in a 48-page King stockbook. The earlier issues are typically used, including a few random Pro Juventute semi-postals, and then gradually more mint issues appear, although overall about 90% of the collection is used. 2021 Scott US$1026.00 =	$1,385.10	$90.00
6395
336	Tanzania #5/1469 plus some BOB. Box with a mixed holding of several hundred stamps on old album pages, Vario pages and in their original glassines as new issues. Starts with the early issues, often both mint and used, in complete sets (with some duplication). This accumulation then changes gears in the mid-1980s, and for the next 10 years, there are about 50 souvenir and mini-sheets, including some that are imperforate. Lots of colourful stamps here, with butterflies, fish, trains and animal topicals. There are some used official overprints from the early years. Overall condition is excellent, with much of the mint items being never hinged. 2023 Scott US$688.00 =	$928.00	$100.00
6128
337	Turks and Caicos Islands #2/358, MR1/13. Binder with mounted collection on homemade pages from 1900 to 1978. The early years up until the early Elizabethan period are mint and (the harder to find) used, often both, with some papers and colour varieties that may appeal to the specialist. By the late 1960’s, the material is mostly mint, although space has been left for used stamps. A bit of material that the collector didn’t get around to adding is included in a pocket. Clean, fresh and mostly lightly hinged. A desirable lot. 2023 Scott US$559.65 =	$755.00	$38.00
5983
338	Turks and Caicos Islands #725/853. Glassine envelopes containing a variety of stamps, as received from the new issue service during a very brief period of 1985-89. About 120 stamps, including 15 miniature or souvenir sheets at a time when collectors had temporarily lost interest in new issues from this Caribbean isle. Saw fish, lizard, birds, butterflies, Christmas and Royals. Most sets are complete with the souvenir sheet. There is a bit of duplication as the collector bought a set of single and a gutter pair of that same set. 2023 Scott US$279.00 =	$376.00	$40.00
5983
339	United Nations - 1977-1983 Large mint never hinged holding of singles, blocks (mostly) and mini-sheets. Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $98.00 U.S. (New York), 151.00SF (Geneva), and 636.00 Austrian shillings. Total face value alone of this lot is $423.00 Canadian (equivalent). Not counted are 8 copies of a “Safety at Sea” souvenir card with various pictorial cancels. Lot is housed in a lovely 16 page Filux stock book with a tan coloured padded cover in terrific condition. UN issues were becoming less popular during this time period and collectors didn’t pursue new issues the way they did in the 1950’s, so less becomes available on the secondary market. The first of a six volume offering in this auction. Total Face Value =	$423.00	$110.00
5531
340	United Nations - 1983-1986 Large mint never hinged holding of blocks (mostly), mini-panes and mini-sheets. Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $81.00 US. (New York), 103.00SF (Geneva), and 872.00 Austrian shillings. Total face value alone of this lot is $350.00 Canadian (equivalent) and is housed in a blue padded cover 16 page Filux stockbook. UN issues were becoming less popular during this time and collectors didn’t pursue new issues the way they did in the 1950’s, this less material from this era becomes available on the secondary market. Total Face Value =	$350.00	$110.00
5531
341	United Nations - 1986-1989 Large mint never hinged holding of stamps, blocks (mostly), mini-panes and mini-sheets. Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $115.00 U.S. (New York), 132.00 Swiss Francs (Geneva) and 867.00 Austrian shillings. Total face value alone of this lot is $438.00 Canadian (equivalent) and is housed in a blue padded cover 16 page Filux stockbook. UN issues were becoming less popular during this time and collectors didn’t pursue new issues the way they did in the 1950’s. Note: A couple of the sheetlets have minor damage in the selvedge, mentioned "for the record". Total Face Value =	$438.00	$110.00
5531
342	United Nations - 1989-1992 Large mint never hinged holding of singles, blocks (mostly), mini-panes and mini-sheets. Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $88.00 U.S. (New York), 200.00 Swiss Francs (Geneva) and 1468.00 Austrian shillings. Includes three cards not counted in the total face value of this lot which comes out at $566.00 Canadian (equivalent). The lot is housed in a green coloured padded cover 16 page Filux stockbook. UN issues were becoming less popular (and apparently un-affordable) during this time and collectors didn’t pursue new issues the way they did in the 1950’s. Total Face Value =	$566.00	$110.00
5531
343	United Nations - 1995-1998 Large mint never hinged holding of singles, blocks (mostly), mini-panes and mini-sheets (tiny bid of duplication in this lot). Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $94.00 U.S. (New York), 184.00 Swiss Francs (Geneva), and 1340.00 Austrian shillings.

Total Face Value =	$537.00	$110.00
5531
344	United Nations - 1998-2000 The last of the six volume holding (there never was a book that covered 1992-5), of mint never hinged singles, blocks (mostly), mini-panes and mini-sheets (definitely some duplication in this lot). Uncatalogued, but face value of stamps is $137.00 U.S. (New York), 175.00 Swiss Francs (Geneva), and 1216.00 Austrian shillings. Total face value of this lot is $568.00 (Canadian $ equivalent). The lot is housed in a red coloured padded cover 16 page Filux stockbook. Total Face Value =	$568.00	$110.00
5531
345	USA #25/2095 plus Back of the Book. Useful collection of used and mint stamps housed in a Harris "All American" album running from 1897 up to 1984, including a BoB section. The catalogue value is mostly in the period 1857 to 1932, consisting of 350 stamps with an owner's 2018 Scott catalogue value of US$4,125.00 plus a "Back of the Book" section of 55 stamps with an owner's Scott value of US$456.00. The remainder of the collection, running from 1933 to 1984 consists of 1,193 stamps, mostly mint hinged, plus 120 BoB issues. Decent degree of completion and a good basis for expansion. Estimate =	$450.00	$325.00
2776
346	USA #98. Fine used example of the 1868 issue 15c black Lincoln with "F" grill (9mm x 13mm). Light unobtrusive cancel in black. 2023 Scott US$275.00=	$371.25	$60.00
5742
347	USA #230/550. A miscellaneous group of mint stamps, 53 in total, all 1893-1920 period issues. Scott catalogued colour varieties are prominent and while they look reasonably accurate, all have been identified by the consignor and would need expertising for confirmation. Almost all Hinged (the odd stamp may be no gum). The #379B rose reds are not catalogued (goodness knows why) and they have simply been valued as red. Owner's 2017 US Scott Specialized US$1,413.75=	$1,908.56	$120.00
1315
348	USA #424-439. Fifteen of the sixteen 1913-1915 issue Washington Franklins (missing only #440, the 50c value), all perf 10 x 10, watermark 190 (single-lined USPS). OG with Heavy Hinge Remnants but otherwise a sound and fresh group. 2023 Scott $940.00=	$1,269.00	$180.00
5115
349	USA #PR5. Fine Unused, no-gum (as issued) example of the 1875 reprint of the 1865 issued Newspaper and Periodical stamp on hard white paper. An upper margin example, with selvedge. Only 10,000 of these were printed. A seldom seen US "back of the book" issue. 2022 USA Scott Specialized US$225.00 =	$303.75	$50.00
6447
350	USA - Carton crammed with a range of US material including three binders with stamps, blocks and cancels. Saw a couple hundred uncacheted FDCs and cacheted event covers from the 1950’s-70’s, including a binder with about 25 Hummel Christmas themed covers, with winter or Christmas themed cancels on nice cachets (original cost would have been significant). While most of the stamps are used, we did notice about US$40.00 of modern postage from the 33c era. Every remaining space in the box is filled with envelopes and baggies filled with stamps. Estimated value =	$130.00	$32.00
3613
351	USA - Flat pizza-box with interesting mid-20th century assortment on 102 cards, with some in envelopes and a few covers. Includes a well-centred, NH, plate # block of 6 of Scott #650, 9 NH Washington-Franklin booklet panes, lots of airmails (including matching material from Canal Zone), and some US Savings stamps. There is about US$50.00 in mint postage from the 3c-35c era along with 50 covers with Naval and Space exploration themes and a couple of envelopes of on / off paper round out this interesting offering. Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00
5495
352	USA - The "Kimball/Kinball" Precancel Error. Two blocks of four and 20 single examples of the 3c purple Liberty precancelled for use in Kimball, Nebraska with the scarce "KINBALL NEBR." misspelling of the town name. Comes with the relevant page from the 1963 edition of the standard precancel catalogue (1963 retail $5.00 each compared to 10c for a regular precancel type). One of our clients has come across a small holding of these. According to the consignor, "KINBALL" precancel errors were recently selling for US$60.00 each (which would mean that this group has a total retail of US$1,680.00!). Note that this is the last group of these errors that we have left on consignment. Estimate =	$120.00	$22.00
6360
353	USA - Two cartons packed with mostly used 20th century stamps. Saw a dozen binders with a modern dealer’s holding (and some mounted collections) on over 220 manila stock sheets (worth a fair penny in their own regard). Also saw five red stockbooks of various sizes and conditions, including one with some mint postage from the 8c era. Although we didn't see anything of particular scarcity, there is substantial value in the sheer quantity, plus the pages and stockbooks. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
2060
354	USA Covers - Small box, packed with collector made First Day Covers from the 2000's (looks to go til about 2010). Along with being a group of unusual cachet FDC, the collector also made a point of visiting some obscure Post Offices within Washington State and Oregon to get these First Day Covers cancelled. A wealth of modern cancels, alongside a fair-size investment in stamps alone! A total of 1189 covers in here, very conservatively estimated at less than 10c each! Estimate =	$110.00	$32.00
3613
355	USA Covers - Washington State Post Office collection. A collector's project of collecting images (photographs) of the Post Office during the late 1990's / early 2000's, accompanied by a cover postmarked at the same location. Banker's box containing home-made pages, which feature 538 covers and 538 photographs from a wide array of both city and rural Post Offices, neatly arranged on page to show one cover and one photograph from the Post Office. These were all created as one-of-a-kind items, purely for the collector, who was (whether he realized it or not) preserving the history of the Post Office during that period. You can imagine the hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars it would take to produce this after factoring in the gas, postage, supplies and photo development! Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
6431
356	USA Precancels - Accumulation of 484 from earlies to modern, A few duplicates, but great variety & note some unusual and different types, especially check out the fourth scan with modern. Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00
3612
357	USA Precancels - Small boxed filled with thousands of precancels, sorted onto 39 manila stocksheets and 102 album pages. Heavily duplicated in spots, but likely some treasures to be found by the precancel enthusiast. Offered as received. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
5435
358	Virgin Islands #4/389. Selection of 344 different mint and used stamps mounted on Scott album pages. The QV and later QEII periods are a bit sparse, but there is strength in the KGV to early Elizabethan period including lots of Omnibus and definitive issues, including a number of hard-to-find used issues. Generally clean, very few obvious faults noted. 2023 Scott US$605.90 =	$817.97	$40.00
5389
359	Wallis and Futuna #1/206 plus airmails. Clean mounted collection of over 300 mint stamps. This South Pacific French outpost produced some interesting issues, including overprints (France Libre) and a number of colourful issues into the 1970’s that were a bit under-appreciated at the time, which now have substantial catalogue value. Mostly complete. Lightly hinged. 2023 Scott US$1235.00 =	$1,667.25	$280.00
5212
360	Worldwide - Box of special presentation / prepared / subscription collections produced by the Kenmore Stamp Company. These high-cost collections were often put together by subscription service over a number of months, or at a one-time purchase price as "special" from the Kenmore company. Lot includes… 1) The Official State Birds and Flowers of the United States with 50 FDC's and two stamps. 2) The Sixtieth Birthday of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 213 stamps and 22 souvenir sheets. 3) Norman Rockwell's Valuable Art on Postage Stamps, with 134 stamps. 4) The Royal Wedding of Prince Charles, The Princes of Wales, Heirs to the British Throne, with 27 covers. 5) Lady Diana Princess of Wales, with 68 stamps and 2 First Day Covers. 6) Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington, with 10 covers. 7) The Presidents of the United States (Liberia collection), with 39 stamps and 4 souvenir sheets.

3613
362	Worldwide - Carton with the remnants of a dozen albums and binders with manila stock pages containing thousands of mint and (mostly) used stamps. A couple are true older worldwide collections, including a few which represent single countries (saw Hungary, Italy, Greece). Most material ranges from the early 20th century up until the 1970’s. While we didn’t note much of significant individual value, there could well be surprises, including some nice cancellations. Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
5939
363	Worldwide - Choice offering of 78 different modern postally used, each stamp catalogues US$5.00 and up. An attractive grouping, with many better hard-to-find issues. Note, each stamp is individually identified on the scans. Very desirable lot! Scott 2022 US$963.00 =	$1,300.05	$100.00

A total of 16,216 stamps (counted album by album) fill these books with a mix of both mint and used material, including a wide array of better stamps and topical interest.

6466
369	Worldwide - Select offering of 76 different mostly modern mint, each stamp catalogues US$5.00 and up. Groups like this are getting tougher to make, as these are in-demand issues. Each stamp is identified on the scans. Some goodies in here! Scott 2022 US$892.00 =	$1,204.20	$80.00

6087
374	Worldwide - Stunning array of dealer "102 cards" in three shoe-box sized plastic bins. Strength in Norway and modern Austria (about 400 cards each), with the remainder from around the world. The amount of cards in here were measured out and come out to the equivalent of 5 "red boxes" to give you an idea of the quantity of material here. A great lot for the worldwide collector or dealer to break apart for re-sale. Estimate =	$325.00	$250.00
5719
375	Worldwide - Three shoeboxes, plus an additional smaller "102" card box, all stuffed with semi-sorted worldwide stamps as accumulated by a collector.

5735
376	Worldwide - Trains of the World Thematic. Box containing two binders and two large envelopes, between them containing approximately 1200 train themed covers, most from the 1960s-80s. Strength in Germany (East and West), Great Britain, with some other Africa, Europe and a bit of Asian material. Didn’t see anything from the Americas. Includes stamps depicting trains, commemorative cancels, anniversaries, (some with attractive cachets). The covers are generally in good shape and would benefit from remounting. A train lover’s dream here. The original time and cost to assemble this originally would have been substantial. Estimate =	$200.00	$70.00
6353
377	Worldwide - Two cartons containing a five volume collection and stock of worldwide stamps including a binder of airmail stamps, binder of worldwide FDCs, some assorted British Commonwealth in a nice stockbook, mounted collections from Cuba and Czechoslovakia (with a few covers), a nice Filux stockbook with Hungary and a binder of almost 400 worldwide commercial covers mostly from the 1980’s-90’s which might have some interesting destinations and rates lurking. The remaining space in the box is filled out with small boxes, bags and pages of loose stamps. Guaranteed fun! Estimate =	$160.00	$200.00
5824
378	Worldwide - U-Haul box with 8 worldwide albums ranging from 1928 to 1975. These collections range from a few hundred stamps to over 10,000 stamps. While they do contain some "school age" material, there is lots of older and interesting material to be found. The collector of classic used material will be able to find interesting items throughout. The best material is from GB (including a Penny Black) and stamps from the QV Jubilee issue to the 1/-, the EDVII issue to the 10d, and a couple of Seahorses too. Lots of interesting items were seen from all around the globe in the worldwide material. Ready for a good sort! Estimate =	$200.00	$325.00

Best items are from Monaco, France and Austria with all being mint never-hinged, with the exception of one Monaco sheetlet which is used. Was catalogued years ago at US$453.00. A quick check indicates that the values are still fairly current and represent a close valuation, even by today's catalogue. Estimate =	$120.00	$42.00
6448
380	Worldwide Covers - Arctic / Antarctic Array of Postal History. Eye-appealing group of 47 covers, each with a connection to either the North or South Pole.

"Thala Dan", Chile Antarctic Research Bases and Falkland Islands covers (from Base Z, Halley Bay, Port Lockroy and Deception Island).

2712
381	Worldwide Covers - Small box containing 448 covers, including many British Commonwealth (good showings of both Australia and Fiji Islands). Primarily from the 1930's to 1970's, there is a good representation of British Commonwealth First Day Covers, USA First Flight Airmail Covers and Worldwide First Flight Airmail. A few of the covers with some foxing on top (from storage) but overall a clean and attractive group. Estimate =	$130.00	$130.00
5979
382	Worldwide Music Topical - Diverse musical topical, covering composers, singers, instruments, songs, Christmas. The largest part of the lot is 300 souvenir or mini sheets, mounted on 55 Vario brand stockpages, with material from most corners of the world. Saw music ranging from tribal/traditional, classical, opera, jazz, Elvis, Michael Jackson, even K-Pop! Not all is modern, including both souvenir sheets for the Anniversary of the Romanian Philharmonic. The mint material is mostly never hinged. The original cost to the collector who assembled this would have been enormous. Estimate =	$160.00	$55.00
4343
383	Worldwide Perfins - Collector's accumulation of 700 unchecked and unpicked WW perfins, arranged on 7 double-sided vario stocksheets (14 pages total). These are put aside by the collector as found in worldwide albums as he sorted, so there is no rhyme or reason for the array of material. While there are a few dozen with noticeable faults, these were purely pulled for perfin interest. Potentially better items mixed in for the keen perfin enthusiast to find. Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00
4776
384	Worldwide Postcards - Old dealer box (from a long-retired dealer) filled with 620 postcards with a wide-array of subject matter, primarily from the pre-WWII period. Some areas of note are Comic Greetings, Art, Expositions, Roadside America and Pretty Ladies (to name a few, but there is much more). There is a "total retail" marking on the box of $1800.00, but we are not sure if that is accurate. Conservatively estimated at about 30 cents per card. Estimate =	$220.00	$210.00
5977
385	Worldwide Postcards - The Great War, WWI France in Ruins. Selection of 75 WWI era postcards, all showing the destruction of cities / towns as a result of German tank bombardment. A good variety of locations, with the majority being views of Somme, Arras and Ypres. A visually stunning group, with all cards here now over 100 years old! Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00
4582
386	Worldwide Supplies - A lightly / reasonably used group of 16 stockbooks, filling a bankers box. A range of sizes, mostly 16-32 pages (8 or 16 page double sided). Mostly Uni-Safe or Lighthouse brand with white pages, but with a couple others in the mix too. Noted a couple have a few stamps in them, which can be removed easily enough. With the price of supplies on the rise, and global supply chain complications making it more difficult to stock up, this is a great opportunity to acquire a large group of stockbooks with lots of life left in them. Estimate =	$140.00	$220.00
6466
387	Worldwide Supplies - Banker's box, filled with an assortment of use-full lightly used or unused supplies as received. Lot includes 1) 100-Pack of glassine inter-leaf (for stamp album pages). 2) Uni-Safe brand padded 3-ring album. 3) Uni-Safe brand padded #10 cover album. 4) Bundle of about 50 dealer manila stock-cards (brand new). 5) Vario black two-sided stocksheets x 33 (various sizes), plus 4 un-opened packs (20 pages) of Vario clear 4-line stocksheets. 6) Brand-New Stanly Gibbons simplex spring-back album (still in box, $59.25 retail sticked attached). 7) Mint Sheet Files x 4, plus several mint block files (pocket sized). 8) Stamp Drying Book. 9) Uni-Safe brand quadrille pages (3-hole punched). 10) Dozens of full / partially full black mounts (mostly Uni-Safe or Showgaurd brand). Total original retail on these supplies would be staggeringly high. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
6012
388	Worldwide Supplies - Black two-sided stocksheets. Small box containing 177 black two-sided lightly used stocksheets of various makes, but primarily Vario or Lighthouse brand (including some new in package). Still lots of life left in these, with only a handful having the occasional small sticker (put on by the previous owner) which could easily be removed. The breakdown of sizes is 3-row (86), 4-row (65), 4-pocket (19) and 8-row (7). Retail on these pages is not over $1 per page. Estimate =	$120.00	$85.00
4472
389	Worldwide Supplies - Group of 6 deluxe 3-ring binders, all with slipcases (will all fit the standard 3-ring hole page). Four of the six are a "Lighthouse style" binders (we would have said they are Lighthouse at first glance, but since there is no Lighthouse branding, they could be made by another company). The remaining 2 binders are Uni-Safe brand deluxe padded albums. All in great condition, with just a bit of clean-up work to remove previous owner's labels from the spine. These deluxe albums are getting pricey to buy new. Estimate =	$120.00	$160.00
6012
390	Worldwide Supplies - Large carton of very worthwhile albums and supplies. There are three Canada themed albums including a Lighthouse regular album 1851-1977 in its original box (the box is a bit beat up, but the album and pages are pristine) - this alone would set you back $200.00. There is older style Lighthouse hingeless album, with a leatherette cover 1851-1971, and a much older style Lindner hingeless album 1851-1958. There are two brand new Rapkin "Favourite Philatelic" springback albums, one blue, one black. One the accessories side there are three unopened packs of 1000 Dennison hinges. Saw 20 packs of black and 10 packs of clear mounts of various sizes (most packages appear unopened). There is also a SAFE Signoscope watermark detector, unfortunately with no power cord but these are about $400.00 new. A few other miscellaneous items round out this worthwhile box. Estimate =	$250.00	$260.00
3732
391	Worldwide Supplies - Lighthouse brand "Sherlock" Watermark Detector. A lightly-used, working example of the high-end, compact watermark detector. Extremely easy to use : insert stamp, turn on light and view. The specials feature of this watermark detector are the different light colours (white, red, green and blue) along with an adjustable brightness. Toted by Lighthouse to "reveal every detail of your stamps, whether it is watermarks or paper irregularities, quality defects or repairs". This is the first time we have offered a used one for sale. Original retail cost =	$399.95	$300.00
5827
392	Worldwide Supplies - Manila Stocksheets. A small box containing 100 lightly / moderately used stocksheets. The standard 3-ring hole punch pages are ready to be given a binder and live another day. The "new" retail cost on these is over $150.00. A very cost-effective way to store your duplicates without having to pay retail for them. Estimate =	$80.00	$60.00
5016
393	Worldwide Supplies / Stamps - Banker's box, filled with 13 reasonably used stockbooks, mostly 16-32 pages (8 or 16 page double sided). All are filled to various degrees with an array of Worldwide stamps. Although mostly cheaper stamps, there are possible finds to be had for the adventurous collector. A nice chance to acquire a large group of stockbooks, with thousands of WW stamps at the same time. Estimate =	$200.00	$170.00
6466
394	Worldwide Topicals - Fine Arts Topical stamp collection. Includes dancing (including Ice dancing), painting, musical instruments, festivals, costumes, musicians, singers, opera, packed into 5 black page Lighthouse stock books. Wide range of countries and eras represented. Includes mint, used, CTO, with some souvenir sheets included. Probably a couple of thousand stamps. Condition is clean and the material is pleasingly displayed. Perfect to rearrange or expand as-is. There are three additional stockbooks included in this lot which have either unrelated topics or are almost empty. In total, you are getting 4 x 8-page stockbooks and 4x 16-page stockbooks, which are in good condition. The value of the used stockbooks worth the estimate alone. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6466
395	Worldwide Topicals - Music Topical collection housed in NINE 8-page black Lighthouse stockbooks. This lot contains a couple thousand stamps for the music lover, and while weighted towards classical music (one book is dedicated to Mozart and another to Beethoven), many other genres are covered. Includes composers, musicians, songs, musical venues. Almost every country in the world seems to be represented. There are mint, used, CTO, with some souvenir sheets and the occasional cover or post card thrown in the mix. The condition is very clean, and only minor duplication is noted. Unchecked for better issues. Warning: contains hours of fun, with the estimate being about the value of the stockbooks alone. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6466
396	Worldwide Topicals - Space/Astronomy collection of stamps and covers that seem to have gotten jumbled upon re-entry! The stamp portion includes several hundred stamps mounted on a variety of very specialized album pages (saw Lighthouse, both regular and hingeless, Kabe, homemade). The pages are loose, duplicated, and only partially in order, meaning that some organization is required. There are a few packets which contain a few hundred more recent purchases that are in envelopes awaiting sorting and mounting. About 200 worldwide covers tied to various space missions are included, with strength in the Apollo missions from the late 1960’s – many US and British covers noted. There are about 90 German Democratic Republic covers circa 1982 with commemorations of various space trips. The box concludes with a dozen panels produced by "CosmoPhil" circa 1970 to promote the topical collecting of space stamps. Estimate =	$200.00	$55.00
4343
397	Worldwide Topicals - The 1988 Olympics Topical. Deluxe German printed album, limited to only 3000 copies (this being #2961) featuring 174 stamps, 30 souvenir sheets, 1 booklet, 47 covers and 6 postal stationery postcards (the latter being a set of Chinese illustrated postcards). Each neatly arranged in mounts on pages describing the issue and Olympic event (in German). Noted a group of 10 athlete signed covers from sports such as fencing, shootings and rowing, plus a pair of coin / stamp combination covers from Portugal and Korea. All items are in pristine condition, with the stamps being Never-Hinged. An attractive sports topical collection. Estimate =	$200.00	$70.00
5898
398	Yugoslavia #1302/1758. Group of 5 manilla stock cards crammed with quantities of large blocks, sheetlets and the occasional souvenir sheet from the 1970's / 1980's. The previous owner counted 287 different issues with a total of 2096 mint stamps. An additional 132 cancelled-to-order stamps were noted, but not considered when valued. An interesting lot with topical interest. Estimate =	$120.00	$22.00
2299
399	Zimbabwe #885 / 1092. Group of nine complete sets from the 2001-2009 period, all in blocks or panes (all being inscription blocks). An interesting and diverse group of subject including Beijing Olympics, National Animals, National Heroes, Paintings and Folklore. The latter period of this group was during an unusual period for stamp issuing in this country, with hyperinflation of the Zimbabwean currency making many of the values obsolete between the time of stamp printing and issuing to the public. Although against the law, most goods within the country were traded using foreign currencies and the Zimbabwe dollar was so unstable. 2023 Scott US$528.00 =	$712.80	$170.00
5841
400	Zululand #1/20. Lovely accumulation of 40 QV overprints and keyplates displayed on a Hagner stocksheet. There is a mix of mint (most with hinge remnants) and used (with many clear, readable cancels). Saw values up to 1/- and individual catalogue values to about $75.00, #45 has a minor scuff on the front, otherwise the overall condition is excellent. The bit of duplication will give you the opportunity to choose which items are best for your collection and might allow you to recoup some costs from a fellow collector. When was the last time you saw a Southern African offering of this type? 2023 Scott US$582.50 =	$786.40	$110.00

Lot #	Description	Cat. Val./Est.	Price Realized
1	Africa - A mostly-African "catch-all" on 35 manilla pages including South Africa, Congo, Egypt, Portuguese and French Colonies. Follow this up with 11 stocksheets of Mauritius (from a dealer’s stock cataloguing $400.00 in 2005!), Sierra Leone, Swaziland and Tristan da Cunha. Finally, there are 400 used stamps from Singapore on dealer approval pages (only minimal duplication). A worthwhile grouping! Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
2919
2	Albania #C1-7, C8-C14, C16-C21, C29-C35, C36-C42, C43-C46, C47-C53. Stunning Mint group of Albanian airmail issues, very-lightly hinged on original old-time album pages. Post Office fresh colours throughout. Also includes #C8a, the double overprint variety (one inverted). Nice quality sets like these don't come up for sale often! 2023 Scott US$557.75 =	$752.96	$260.00
1858
3	Ascension #10/60. Mint and used neatly organized duplicated selection of 134 GeoV and GeoVI era stamps, 1924-1949 issues. Excellent range of shades and perfs, all identified, numbered and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. 2022 Scott US$525.35=	$709.22	$95.00
3223
4	Ascension #10-12, 13(x 2), 16-21. Sound and F/VF mint Hinged selection of 11 different 1924 to 1933 GeoV "Seal of the Colony" issues. A fresh and colourful group. An extra 2d value noted in the mix. 2022 Scott Classic US$401.25=	$541.69	$160.00
5734
5	Ascension #61/918, J1-J6. Almost all mint neatly organized duplicated selection of 549 QEII era stamps and souvenir sheets, 1953-2007 period issues. All identified, numbered and valued on ten Hagner brand stock sheets. Loaded with useful sets and topicals. A perfect lot for the show/internet dealer. 2022 Scott US$635.70=	$858.20	$120.00
3223
6	Australia #1/3552 plus BOB. Superb five-volume collection in Stanley Gibbons albums with matching slipcases. The earlier issues have lots of "Roos and KGV "Heads" and a fairly complete run of low to medium values through the 2£ Arms. Unfortunately many of the higher value earlier stamps have condition issues. Starting with the later 1970’s issues, the collector gradually moved from exclusively used stamps to a mix of mint and used, often because of the difficulty of finding used copies of se-tenant issues, souvenir sheets or higher denominated stamps. For issues between 1990 and 2007, we counted mint issues with a face value of $650.00 AUD. The albums themselves would cost over $650.00 today. The owner added clear top open mounts in which most stamps are mounted. Scott numbers were penciled in beside the existing Stanley Gibbons numbers. The added mounts and stamps have thickened the albums significantly - to the point that one of the slipcovers has partially burst. The collection would benefit from a couple more binders and slipcovers. Conservatively, valued at the usable AUD face value alone. Total face value AUD$650.00 =	$591.62	$325.00
5841
7	Australia #128/221. Quintet of Specimen overprints on 1 pound ‘Roo (#128, no gum), Robes (#178, lightly hinged) and the full Arms set (#219-221, lightly hinged). The 5/- is not known as a Specimen. All with great appearance and make a nice addition to round out your KGV-era Aussie collection. Estimate =	$180.00	$120.00
1786
8	Australia #130-132. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge set, fine to very fine used, with nice light corner CDS cancels. Fresh, striking examples of the key commemorative issue for Australia during the KGV period. 2023 Scott catalogue value US$280.60 =	$378.80	$150.00
5479
9	Australia #221. Bottom plate inscription pair of the key 2-pound denomination. Fresh, well centred and never hinged. Very few inscription blocks of this issue exist because of the enormous face value. Conservatively valued as singles, but worth much more as an inscription pair! 2023 Scott US$350.00 =	$472.50	$160.00
1786
10	Australia #CO1, O1-O2. Fresh and F/VF mint OG Hinged trio of OS (On Service) overprinted 1931-1932 Kingsford Smith commemorative and airmail official issues. 2023 Scott Classic US$320.00=	$423.00	$120.00
5410
11	Australia #M1-M7. BCOF overprints on animal / robe issue for British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan at the end of the Second World War. A complete fresh, lightly hinged set. One of the key KGVI sets from Australia. 2023 Scott US$209.50 =	$282.80	$110.00
5815
12	Australia - New South Wales #O32b. The 5/- map of Australia design overprinted "OS" (with a break in the "S") and overprinted "Specimen". Hinged, as normal for this era, but a strikingly clean and beautiful example of this key value of the 1888 Official set (perf 10). A great item to spice up your Australian States collection. The regular stamp weighs in with a catalogue value of US$675.00. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
6087
13	Australia - Tasmania #11a/107. Selection of 13 better mint issues, including a nice copy of #11a (with traces of original gum), and followed by #57a, 58b, 64, 71a, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 104, 106, 107. Most items are very attractive, including stamps from the "Scenery" issue. A hinged group, with some typical heavy hinging for this era. 2023 Scott US$1057.50 =	$1,427.50	$100.00
5991
14	Australia States - Hodge-podge from all six states, with mint, used, some back of the book and even some revenue stamps or cancels on five Vario brand stockpages. The catalogue value is immense, but there are some of the condition issues that are normal for the early QV issues. A couple of official perfins noted. New South Wales (13 stamps), Queensland (40), South Australia (29), Tasmania (72), Victoria (78) and Western Australia (25). Check out the scans to see how attractive these stamps are. We are confident that there are gems to be found here. Estimate =	$250.00	$325.00
5977
15	Austria #15/717. Accumulation of Austria in an old portfolio, a springback album, exploded stockbook pages, manilla stocksheets and a small stockbook. Suitable for unravelling over a number of sittings. The earlier issues are primarily used, with heavy duplication throughout. Noted several complete mint sets of the Castles definitives and a couple of presentation cards for the Mozart issue of 1956. There must be over 4000 stamps here. Enjoy diving into this! Estimate =	$160.00	$80.00
6466
16	Austrian Empire #1/387 plus BOB including Bosnia and Herzegovina. Discovery awaits in this collection of 1120 stamps mounted on Schaubek pages, with a range of classic, mostly used Austria (including a nice copy of #127). Lots of postage dues, military issues, newspaper stamps. Empire issues include Offices in Crete, Turkey (which will need your critical eye) and Lombardy-Venetia. The lot concludes with Bosnia and Herzegovina, while under the Austro-Hungarian empire. We noted some nice cancels for the postmark enthusiast. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
4686
17	Barbados #328/1009 plus BOB. Not often seen collecting area, mounted on homemade album pages and stocksheets. Combination of mint, mostly never hinged and used, with a few covers or larger pieces.

18	Bechuanaland Protectorate - Sextet of Southern African classic issues, including #11 & 12 (both no gum), 79, 92a, 93, 103. While all are mint and hinged, they are fresh in appearance and far better than average copies. The Seahorses in particular are striking. Bechuanaland was a forerunner to Cape of Good Hope, which was later rolled into South Africa. For collecting purposes, a very manageable British colony. 2023 Scott US$514.00 =	$693.90	$130.00
3408
19	Belgium #18/1004 plus BOB. Lovely, near new 5 volume Lighthouse hingeless albums with matching light brown slipcases, with pages covering 1849-2017. The collector hadn’t switched focus from purchasing the albums to filling them, though there are several hundred used stamps up to about 1980. The owner lightly penciled in Scott numbers under each entry, which will can either aid in your guidance or be erased. Didn’t see anything remarkable with the value of the stamps. The value in this offering is for the albums, which have a list price from Lighthouse at over $2800! Estimate =	$700.00	$550.00
4472
20	British Africa - Selection of Mint "Earlies". All sound and F/VF mint OG Hinged selection of 71 different 19th and early 20th century issues from Lagos, Nigeria, Kenya & Uganda, East Africa & Uganda Protectorate, Uganda, Niger Coast Protectorate and Natal, all laid out on two Hagner stock sheets.

4827
22	British Central Africa #18. A lovely looking revalued 3/- on 4/- overprinted in 1893. One of the key values for this British African colony. A couple of pulled perfs do not significantly impact its appearance. Nice CDS cancels. 2023 Scott US$400.00 =	$540.00	$95.00
6136
23	British Central Africa #52. The higher value 3/- denomination with the Coat of Arms design. Hinge remnant, minor gum bending. Still a very attractive stamp and seldom seen. 2023 Scott US$350.00 =	$472.50	$95.00

Owner's older 2019 Scott US$2973.00 =	$4,013.00	$260.00
5719
26	British Commonwealth - Colourful accumulation, mostly from smaller colonies from the Caribbean and South Pacific. Starts with a binder with 20 stocksheets filled with mostly mint QEII-era sets and souvenir sheets, including topical interest (birds, animals, Beatles, Disney). Finishes with a 60-page red stockbook (only about ¼ full) with new issue purchases from the late 1970s, including Falklands, Cocos, St. Vincent, Montserrat. Most are never hinged. Huge cost to the previous owner. Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6486
27	British Honduras and Belize - A collector's somewhat messy accumulation of Mint and Used, comprising of several different auction lots, mixed pages, loose, in album and stockbooks as acquired over the years. Many better items throughout including a great showing of the early QV material including overprints. This will likely prove to be a real treasure trove for the patient collector willing to spread this out on a table and work on it over a period of time. Well worth the estimate. Estimate =	$500.00	$525.00
4741
28	Burma - Stockbook featuring a few sparse, but powerful pages of Burma material, starting with India used in Burma (including India #1a, the 1854 red), then into GeoV issues including overprints, Japanese Occupation stamps including the "Farmer Plowing" issue and then post-1950 material (up to about 1964).

6395

54	Canada #104/119, 140. All mint OG Hinged duplicated selection of 36 GeoV Admirals (15 different, not counting shades, printings, dies, etc). All valued as the basic (cheapest) Scott listed types. A good lot for the Admiral dealer/student. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,620.00=	$2,187.00	$80.00
6301
55	Canada #104/183. All F/VF mint OG Hinged (a few NH also noted, valued as Hinged) selection of 39 different 1911 to 1931 period GeoV small format definitive stamps and one booklet pane.

6484
59	Canada #114 (x 3), 114iv. Fresh and VF mint NH part inscription upper sheet margin block of four of the 7c red brown GeoV Admiral (dry printing), showing the "line in V of SEVEN" plate variety in the lower right stamp. This faint but constant plate flaw is only from the plate #7 printings. LH in the upper sheet margin only, all four stamps pristine NH. 2023 Unitrade =	$765.00	$210.00
4464
60	Canada #119c. Fresh VF mint NH example of the 20c GeoV Admiral, in the Unitrade listed distinctive 1912 dark olive green (wet printing) shade. Perfectly centered within balanced margins.

5526
63	Canada #131i, 132i. VF mint NH paste-up pairs of the 1c green and 2c carmine perf 12 GeoV Admiral coils. Due to the nature of the paste-up process, these are hard to find with better centering. 2023 Unitrade =	$412.50	$90.00
5526
64	Canada #131vii. Fresh and Fine mint NH example of the 1915 issue 1c green perf 12 GeoV Admiral coil with the Unitrade listed "Shilling Mark" plate variety. A very scarce Admiral coil variety. 2023 Unitrade =	$350.00	$300.00

2271
66	Canada #141/1125. Clean and high quality all mint (and mostly NH) starter collection of 323 different stamps and souvenir sheets, all housed in a CWS "Unity" album. The stamps contained in the album range from issues of 1927 up to 1987 and consist of a nice mix of regular commemoratives and definitives (no "Back of the Book").

6025
68	Canada #160-161, 178-183, 205-207, 228-230. Sound, fresh and mint Hinged complete run of all the 1929-1935 post-Admiral GeoV coil issues, all in F/VF pairs. 2023 Scott Classic US$524.00=	$707.40	$65.00

5424
70	Canada #227, 227i. VF mint NH examples of both the blue and pale blue shades of the 1935 issue $1.00 Champlain Statue. Subtle yet distinct Unitrade listed shades. 2023 Unitrade =	$255.00	$110.00
6475
71	Canada #231-321. Fresh, sound and VF all mint LH complete run of 1937 to 1953 GeoVI regular issues, including all the high value sets and singles (Chateau Ramezay, War and Peace pictorial sets, Fish Dollar, Totem Dollar). Both the perf 8 and 9½ War issue coil sets and the extra shade of the 10c Memorial Chamber are here. A great opportunity to fill the GeoVI section of your album all at once with high quality mint material! 2023 Scott cat US$470.70=	$635.45	$65.00
6475
72	Canada #926A. VF quality offering of the short lived 1987 issue 36c plum QEII definitive, including two VF mint NH sealed matched sets of blank corner blocks (these don't come with inscriptions), a full mint NH sheet of 100, two Canada Post cacheted FDCs (single and corner block), a QEII "Maximum Card" and 8 singles on "in period "commercial envelopes. This October 1st issue definitive was delayed repeatedly (from May 6, 1987) due to production difficulties and not released until near the end of the 36c rate period. Thus, this value was current for just three months, during which time the 1987 Christmas stamps would have seen most of the usage. A clean and increasingly scarce investment group. The covers/FDCs are very conservatively valued at $3.00 each. 2023 Unitrade =	$606.00	$170.00
1786
73	Canada #937, 937i, 937ii. Archival quality group of VF mint NH matched sets of inscription blocks of the 1983-1985 issue $5.00 Point Pelee high value pictorial definitive, consisting of a complete set of all three different plates, each on a different paper stock (Abitibi-Price, Clark, Harrison). The key plate #3 in particular is becoming extremely hard to find. Total face value is $240.00 but worth much more. 2023 Unitrade =	$910.00	$450.00
6442
74	Canada #977. Two complete VF MNH sheets of 25 of the 1983 issue $2.00 Commonwealth Day high value commemorative with inscriptions in all four corners. Valued by Unitrade catalogue as 8 inscription blocks and 18 singles. Except for the 1976 Olympic $1.00 and $2.00 stamps, these were the first $1.00+ face value commemoratives since the 1897 Jubilees! Since then, the Post Office seems to have since then fallen love with issuing all kinds of high value commemoratives but none are as scarce as this early 80's tribute to the British Commonwealth of Nations! 2023 Unitrade =	$725.00	$250.00
6442
75	Canada #1250ii. Lower left position VF mint NH inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative as well as the lower left inscription block on First Day Cover (nice to get a matched pair). Most inscription blocks were withdrawn due to problematic and incredibly poor printing quality. Only one inscription block was allowed per customer and only through mail order from the National Philatelic Centre. 2023 Unitrade =	$375.00	$130.00
6475
76	Canada #1630ai. Unopened Post Office pack, containing 50 examples of the 1996 Lunar New Years souvenir sheet with the "Hong Kong 97" logo printed on the bottom right corner. These souvenir sheets were specially printed for sale at the 1997 International Stamp Show held in Hong Kong. As this pack is still sealed, it is unchecked for the #1630ci missing gold variety. 2023 Unitrade =	$500.00	$140.00
6475
77	Canada #1969a. Rare VF MNH lower left plate block of 4 of the 48c Lunar New Year of the Ram 2003 issue with the gold Chinese inscriptions omitted ERROR on ALL FOUR stamps. While there were only a few sheets discovered with gold printing missing in the left selvedge and the first column of stamps, there were only 2 sheets recorded with the gold inscriptions missing on the TWO left column stamps and the selvedge. Potentially a "1 of 2" for the known examples of the LL plate block. 2023 Unitrade =	$1,200.00	$525.00
870
78	Canada #2012a, 2014a, 2253c, 2298a, 2304a. COUNTERFEIT BOOKLET selection. An interesting group of five different self-adhesive booklets, created to defraud the Canadian Post Office. While at first glance, these booklets look good, but on closer inspection it becomes clear they are not what they purport to be (blurred images, no tagging, missing micro-printing etc). All still on original sales cards from Saskatoon Stamp Centre and accompanied by a copy of the extensive article written on this subject by Leopold Beaudet published in the Corgi Times in December 2006. Total retail as marked =	$444.35	$120.00

79	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each folder containing a souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly (impossible to find) and dog (almost as hard to find) thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. These complete sets have and will increase greatly in price in the next few years. 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$100.00
6442
80	Canada #2808ii. The 2015 issue "Stylized Fabric Flag" Uncut Press Sheet containing 23 of the $5 self-adhesive Canada Flag stamps.

The "wrong" issues are particularly difficult to find and key items from the last decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign. 2023 Unitrade =	$347.40	$300.00
6032
82	Canada #2922i. The uncut press sheet of 12 souvenir sheets from the popular lenticular Star Trek issue from 2016. This uncut press sheet was pricier than most, with a total face value of $120.00.

The consignor has identified some Unitrade listed paper varieties in the mix and has estimated a Unitrade catalogue value of around $900.00. Note that many of these paper types are hard to positively identify. Still a useful lot for the "Back of the Book" student. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00

Both complete with MNH stamps arranged in mounts and BOTH come with the original Canada Post envelope. The 1974 year set is the "unpunched" version, not having received the 3-hole punch.

6415

Earlies from the First Cents, Small Queens, Jubilees, Edward and Tercentenary issues.

3543
113	Canada - Deluxe Lighthouse Hingeless Album # 2. Premium album with slipcase containing both MNH and used issues for 1987-1999 period.

133	Canada Covers - Deluxe Edition "The Story of Canada" First Day Covers 1982-1989. Very expensive collection of specially prepared deluxe First Day Covers in four volumes, all with slipcases. This "The Story of Canada" collection consists of 80 different gold foil cacheted FDCs, all mounted on a full colour illustrated page with a story on the event being commemorated, along with a VF mint NH Canadian (or Newfoundland) stamp also associated with the event. Not a complete run of all the covers, as many of the subscribers ended the acquisition of these pricey items ($9.95 each for an original cost for this lot of $796.00) as the cost became excessive. Still a great collection for the fan of Canadian history and scarce cachet types for the FDC cachet collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00
6363

Also includes the 1974 RCMP stamp / coin combination FDC and the 1993 Hockey stamp / coin combination FDC with sterling silver coin.

136	Canada Covers - First Flight Cover (FFC) accumulation in a small box.

A wide-array of material here, with the non-Canadian material featuring early (1842) GB Tax Office, Australian Official mail and a good number of QEII franked covers from around the commonwealth (many addressed to Canada). The Canadian material showcases material starting with an 1890 "Post Office Business" envelope (very unusual), followed by several 1890's Money Order covers and then a bit of everything from across the country including both OHMS / "G" overprints and OHMS perfin material. A nice chance to pick up a large lot of this material at one time! Estimate =	$250.00	$325.00
4638

This one with 6 covers (and one faulty stamp chosen for postmark), including frankings of #1, 5, 6 and 14 dated from the late 1860's to early 1870's. The provincial usages of Prince Edward Island can be notoriously faulty….as it much of this selection. Also includes the "Gold Ribbon" awarded by the local (BC) Sidney Stamp Club. The Scott Specialized value for stamps on cover is US$1020.00, but due to condition...we have elected to estimate this one. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00

3634
216	Cook Islands #1/810 plus BOB. A battered stockbook as weathered the storm and protected this lovely accumulation from this South Pacific country, formerly administered by New Zealand. The first page is spectacular with far better than normal examples from the first two issues, along with the early Bird stamps, mostly in their usual mint, hinged condition. Closely followed by the New Zealand overprints (with postal fiscals to 5/-). The relatively organized and only lightly duplicated start, gives way to a packed, heavily duplicated stock, with the occasional higher value definitive, set or souvenir sheet emerging. There are some semi-postals, Airmails, officials and a wide range of overprints and revalues that make this a fascinating collecting area. Our estimated count of 850 stamps is likely conservative, as is the 2021 Scott US$1240.00 =	$1,674.00	$230.00
5734
217	Cook Islands #78/1264, B1/20, C1/93, O1/15. A significant collection of 1480 different stamps mounted on album pages, mostly mint in black mounts. Includes issues ranging covering most of the 20th century, with the earlier classic period with nice clean examples, then many of the overlooked issues from the turn of the Millennium which are well represented including many souvenir sheets. There is also an above-average representation from the back of the book. The mint items are never-hinged from the mid-70s onwards. Total 2021 Scott US$1260.00 =	$1,701.00	$230.00
5734
218	Czechoslovakia #1/2858. Starts with an old portfolio with a mounted collection of mostly earlier Czech issue, with lots of nice cancels and then some of the mid-century items in tabbed pairs. This collection is complemented with 5 stocksheets with more modern offerings, such as space sheetlets and a striking 1945 National Uprising card (uncancelled). Patience may reward. Estimate =	$120.00	$34.00
5841
219	Czechoslovakia - Prague Party Pack! A bundle of stock pages, a stockbook and a mint sheet file bursting with 20th century Czechoslovakia! The most interesting is the grouping of a couple dozen 1930’s-40’s presentation cards and commemorative cancel sheets covering new issues, some related to key events of WWII - a couple with condition issues, most are quite striking. Noted about 30 more recent first day covers, a few with souvenir sheets. There are 2 binders that barely contain the 50-plus manila stocksheets with mostly used stock. The lot concludes with a 16 page black Lighthouse stockbook with a mix of mint and used issues from the 1980’s. Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
5644
220	Denmark #228c, 249c. Duo of Tete-Beche pairs, from the 1933 / 1935 series. Both Mint Never-Hinged condition, with Post Office fresh colours. These can be more elusive than the catalogue value indicates. 2023 Scott $210.00 =	$283.50	$80.00
5577
221	Denmark - Christmas Seal Collection/Accumulation. Sloppily mounted but comprehensive semi-sorted collection/accumulation of hundreds of Christmas seals, running from the first issues of 1904 up to 1972. Includes mint and used seals, se-tenant blocks and full panes. Danish Christmas seals are the original fund-raising Christmas issues, now copied by dozens of countries. A very popular area of collecting for the Cinderella, seal and Christmas topical collector. This lot represents a great start to this historically interesting and legitimate area of philately. Estimate =	$140.00	$34.00
6466
222	Estonia #2/153. Different accumulations from different times. Starts with material from an early 50s dealer stock that includes multiple (and frankly lovely) used copies of #79 ,82, 83, interesting examples from the 1922 set (both perf and imperf, mint) and the 1928 overprints. The second half was described as "potential for the specialist" and is a binder full of #150-153, including some imperf examples of #152 with everything from singles up to large blocks, mostly mint. An offering that you won’t see often. Estimate =	$250.00	$260.00
4466
223	Falkland Islands #16a, 18a. Two medium values from the QV definitive issue of the 1891-98. The 6d is the orange shade, while the 1/- is bistre-brown. Both are F/VF, with hinge remains but are better than average for this period. 2021 Scott US$400.00 =	$540.00	$170.00
2712
224	Falkland Islands #21. The seldom seen 5sh QV high value, mint hinged, with 1 pulled perf. A beautiful example of this key issue from 1898. 2023 Scott US$260.00 =	$351.00	$110.00
2626
225	Falkland Islands - Selection of 112 different modern used, 1972 - 2022 including six "pound values".This modern used material is so dreastically undervalued in comparison to how hard it is to find! 2024 Scott US$130.00 =	$175.50	$65.00
6060
226	Fiji #114/144, B1-B2, J12-J19. Nearly complete mixed mint Hinged and used run of all the 1937 to 1951 period GeoVI issues, including regular, semi-postals and (in particular) postage dues.

163
227	Finland / Aland Islands #1/350. An almost complete run of this autonomous region in Finland. In perfect mint, never hinged condition, arranged in clear mounts on three hole line pages (will benefit from remounting). Includes a number of attractive Frama issues which are not listed in Scott, which is why there are almost 400 stamps in a country with only 350 Scott numbers. Not often seen material, in great shape and mostly complete. 2022 Scott $804.20 =	$1,085.67	$190.00
2879
228	France #109/240, Q13/87 plus other BOB. Mounted on older album pages, this quality (mostly used) collection of early 20th century France has some unusual material, including a good offering of Parcel Post stamps (noted Q65 mint and a few representatives from the unissued "Locomotive" design set). A nice example of B11 is included (Scott $60.00) and six of the reaper issue overprinted for Military franchise use. 2022 Scott US$718.00 =	$969.00	$70.00

Mostly mint and mostly mint NH collection of 1,053 stamps, 1900-1959 period issues, all laid out on printed Lighthouse album pages, housed in a red Lighthouse binder.

5241
234	French Colonies - Strength in Africa, with some from the Americas featured with 424 stamps mounted on 15 Hagner stocksheets up to the turn of the 20th century.

5190
235	Gambia #12/1289. Mint and used 1886-1992 period selection/stock of 413 stamps and souvenir sheets, Victorian era through recent.

5993
236	Germany #138/281. Pristine complete sheets of inflation-era definitives. A total of 71 sheets, with between 1 and 31 sheets of each denomination. All with selvedge, some of which is quite visually stunning. Stored flat, with glassine interleaves and none of the normal curling. The gum is completely intact. There might be some perf separation here and there, but overall a very well-kept lot. The catalogue value as singles would be over US$1700.00. Suitable for framing! Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6025
237	Germany - 1990's to 2002 modern mint offering on black stock cards, bridging from DM to Euro. Lots of sets including definitive issues with face values to 7DM and semi-postals. All mint never hinged. Some unfortunate storage means that many of these have very minor gum disturbance, mentioned "for the record". A count of the face value = 253.66DM + 13.70Euro, coming to a combined face value = $202.00 CDN. Estimate =	$120.00	$32.00
3613
238	Germany - Box of post-war chaos. The previous owner filed his purchases and works in progress and then never got to them. There are albums (DDR, Scott Specialized album with black mounts added), stockpages, dealer cards, auction lots that were never consigned, approval booklets. Almost all are used. Best are semi-postals from 1980’s-2010 and many souvenir sheets of the same period. There is some DDR including the 1954 Stamp Day souvenir sheet (bit wrinkled). Thousands of stamps, with potential value everywhere. Estimate =	$180.00	$200.00
5907
239	Germany - Immediate postwar period of 1945-49 on Lindner hingeless pages. The pages appear to cover every iteration of a stamp-issuing entity during the chaotic period leading up to the Cold War. Includes Germany (#668, B313), Allied Military Government (#3N18), with DDR, Provincial issues, Berlin, Russian Occupation, etc. The collector tried to get a mint and used example of each stamp. Even though there are 550 stamps present, there is still lots of room for expansion. 2021 Scott US$929.00 =	$1,254.15	$150.00
3612
240	Germany - Pan-German offering including DDR, States, Saar, Bohemia & Moravia, General Government. A catch-all offering of stockbooks, 7 old approval books, glassines, notebook, and some loose Harris album pages. Acquired from a range of different sources, this material was mostly purchased and then ignored. There is potential around every corner. Estimate =	$200.00	$90.00
2299
241	Germany - Post WWII Sheets. Three large format sheet files containing a couple of dozen full sheets (both mint NH and CTO used) of stamps from post-war Allied occupation areas, East Germany, Federal Republic and Berlin. The issue period runs from 1945 up to 1989. Noted three VF examples of the 1964 issue 15th Anniversary of the GDR imperf souvenir sheet and various complete sets from all areas.

5977
242	Germany - Berlin #9N1/9N952, 9NB8/9NB285. Lighthouse hingeless pages 1948-90 with binder and matching slip case, with a retail price of over $600.00 (Lighthouse reference 23 B)! But that is not all..692 stamps call this album home, with most issues up to 1972 being used, followed by a mix of mint and used issues. The condition is excellent, with many nice cancels noted. The previous owner has lightly penciled in Scott catalogue numbers under each stamp to aid with identification. 2021 Scott US$731.00 =	$986.85	$240.00
5977
243	Germany - Berlin #9N5/9N459, 9NB4/9NB174. Lovely Lindner hingeless pages in 18-ring binder, covering the post-war period to 1980. The 830 stamps starts off mostly used and then transitions to a lengthy period where the collector tried to obtain a mint and used copy of each issue. Includes some better issues (including #9N33 mint) and other better material from the early 1950’s. The mint stamps are both hinged and never hinged, with a few souvenir sheets and even a couple of complete booklets added to the mix. The album alone has a retail cost of over $400.00! 2021 Scott US$1285.75 =	$1,735.75	$160.00
5977
244	Germany - Berlin and DDR - Accumulation including Germany #39/2223 + Semipostals, Berlin #9N28/9N575 + Semipostals and DDR 10N29/2753a. Dealer stock packing a 48-page Unisafe stockbook with 2800 German stamps. While there are some enticing earlier issues, the strength is post-war, with good representation until 2005. Strong in Semi-postals issues. Some duplication to be expected. Overall condition is good, and many items seem to have been selected for the quality of the cancellation. Everywhere you turn there are $3-$10 items, and possibly more. Beware: 4 pages of modern used Luxembourg snuck into the middle of the pack! Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
6486
245	Germany and States #17/264 plus BOB. Pre-war classics of about 500 stamps housed on 10 Vario stockpages, all held in a 4 ring blue Lighthouse binder with matching slip case. A mix of mint and used, many of which were selected for the quality of their cancel. Includes some nice early semi-postal material. There is also Bavaria, Saar, Wurttemberg, Heligoland, Thurn and Taxis (both North and South, but the stamps look "too good to be true", so are offered "as-is"). A striking offering. Estimate =	$160.00	$160.00
6486
246	Gibraltar #109b/117a. Group of better perforation varieties on the WWII-era KGVI commemorative scenery issue. Includes 109b, 114a, 115b, 116a, 117a. All cleanly used with light cancellations. 2023 Scott US$440.00 =	$594.00	$75.00

249	Great Britain #1. VF++ full four margin used example of the world's first stamp, the famous 1840 issue "Penny Black". Very light Maltese Cross cancel in red. Identified as plate 1B. A choice quality "number one"! 2023 Scott Classic US$450.00=	$607.50	$190.00
1786
250	Great Britain #1, 1a. Used examples of the black and intense black shades of the 1840 issue "Penny Black". The #1 has a light red Maltese Cross cancel and margins that are tight to just in as well as a shallow thin at upper left; the #1a also has a red Maltese Cross cancel, unfortunately slightly cut in at bottom. Unchecked for plate numbers. A nice looking shade duo. 2023 Scott Classic US$975.00=	$1,316.25	$110.00
3656
251	Great Britain #1/1838. First half of a collection of used GB in a packed Stanley Gibbons album. The early has significant catalogue value, but equally significant faults (for example the Penny Black is cut in on all four sides), but there is some redemption with a large number of readable numeral cancels. The QV includes values to 5/-, and noted a complete set of the Jubilees. The KEVII has values to 2/6. Saw four Seahorses, Royal Wedding high values with the collection almost complete from KGVI to the year 1998 (missing is mostly early QEII phosphor). Over 1000 stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$290.00
5660
252	Great Britain #3/660 plus Channel Islands and Regionals. Intriguing homemade album pages packed with predominantly pre-decimal potential. Includes some better QV such as #32, 43, 94. There are also seven "Seahorses", 4 with perfins. There could be some finds in the mint KGVI and QEII Wilding issues for knowledgeable. Even saw some Lundy and Herm poking through. There is a bit of light duplication, but a fun lot to sort out. Estimate =	$160.00	$90.00
6466
253	Great Britain #7. Used example of the 1854 issue embossed 6p red violet, with "VR" watermark (wmk 19). Margins just touching the design at top and right, margin well clear at bottom, showing a portion of the adjacent stamp. A rare early Victorian issue. 2023 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,350.00	$100.00
2168
254	Great Britain #10/1092 plus Regionals and BOB. Classic early Britain is the strength of this 659 stamp collection mounted in a padded Stanley Gibbons 4-ring album with pages to 1984. Better values throughout the QV period, with a significant number of stamps with catalogue values of $50 and up. The basic Jubilee issue is complete and there are respectable showings from KEVII to KGV (with a couple of Seahorses noted). The Elizabethan period brings on more mint, hinged, material, with lots of Wildings including graphite lines and phosphors. The collection gets unexpectedly sparse in the 1960’s and then from 1980-1984 the pages get fairly complete and are all mint again. A number of valuable early issues with visible faults are not included in the catalogue value. 2021 Scott US$2477.00 =	$3,344.29	$180.00
5660
255	Great Britain #10/2529 plus BOB and Regionals. A sublime combination of an old-school GB collection in 5 hingeless Lighthouse albums in green, with matching slipcases (goes up to 2014). These alone have a retail value of $2500(!) and are in excellent condition. The stamps themselves have some potential with a scattering of QV issues, including a host of various plates of #33. The KEVII issues run up to the 5/-. The Seahorses make an appearance in the KGV-era. Unfortunately, the condition is an issue for these earlier stamps, especially those with significant catalogue value. About 1970, the collector turned to mostly mint issues, and we counted a face value of over UK£350.00 ($591.00 CDN equivalent). After the year 2004, the collection inexplicably ends and the last few years the albums are essentially untouched. Whether you are here for the albums, the stamps or the postage, there is something for you. Estimate =	$600.00	$825.00
6484
256	Great Britain #30. Plate #15. Sound, fresh and Fine mint full OG Hinged example of the 1869 issue 2p deep blue "thin line" Victoria, watermark 20 (Large Crown), perf 14 x 14. Plate 15 is the scarcest plate of this issue. 2023 Scott US$500.00=	$675.00	$65.00
4613
257	Great Britain #55, 55a. Three used examples of the 1867 issue 2sh Victoria, Plate #1, watermark 25 (Spray of Rose). Two are in the basic blue shade, the other is in the Scott listed pale blue shade. All still hinged on a portion of the original album page. 2023 Scott Classic US$845.00=	$1,140.75	$75.00
6484
258	Great Britain #57. Fault-free and VF centered used example of the plate #1 type of the 1867 issue 5sh rose large format Queen Victoria, watermark 26 (Maltese Cross). A great looking high value GB Classic. Scott notes a 50% premium for VF centering. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,046.25=	$1,412.44	$120.00
3266
259	Great Britain #58. Plates #5, 6, 11 & 13. All mint OG Hinged quartet of 1870 issue ½p rose "Bantams", all different plate numbers (plates #5, 6, 11 & 13). Noted some of the usual gum wrinkles. A good start to the different plate numbers of this popular issue. 2023 Scott Classic US$550.00=	$742.50	$46.00
6052
260	Great Britain #90. F/VF centered used example of the rare plate #4 printing of the 5sh rose 1882-1883 issue large format Queen Victoria, on bluish paper, watermark 31 (Anchor). Expertly repaired fault, still a great looking high value GB Classic. 2023 Scott Classic US$4,700.00=	$6,345.00	$375.00
347
261	Great Britain #91. Used example of the rare 1882-1883 issue 10sh slate large format Queen Victoria high value, plate 1, watermark 31 (Anchor). Lovely appearance, well centered with a moderate cancel. Small repaired tear at top. Hard to find in any condition. 2023 Scott Classic US$5,250.00=	$7,087.50	$775.00
347
262	Great Britain #96. VF mint example of the 1883 issue 2sh6p lilac large format Queen Victoria high value. Full fresh original gum, small hinge remnant. 2023 Scott Classic US$700.00=	$945.00	$150.00
5115
263	Great Britain #96, 108-109. Sound and VF used trio of large format 1883-1884 issue Queen Victoria high values, consisting of the 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine. All very well centered with clear and legible CDS cancels. 50% premium added for centering and CDS cancels (as per Scott footnotes). 2023 Scott US$1,635.00 =	$2,207.25	$160.00
6025
264	Great Britain #98-107. Generally Fine used complete set of ten 1883-1884 period issues, from the ½p up to the 1sh high value. Expect the odd small fault. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,994.00=	$2,691.90	$55.00
6087
265	Great Britain #108. Fresh mint example of the 1884 issue 5sh carmine rose large format Queen Victoria high value. Full fresh original gum, small hinge remnant. Vertical crease and rounded lower right-hand corner. Still a rare stamp in mint condition. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,150.00=	$1,552.50	$110.00
5115
266	Great Britain #108. The 5/- QV high value overprinted "Specimen" with full original gum, hinged. The regular issue catalogues in at US$1100.00. There is a bit of a thin at the top centre which appears as soiling from the front of the stamp. One pulled perf at the top left but neither the small thin or pulled perf heavily distract from this very attractive bit of philatelic eye candy. Estimate =	$200.00	$42.00
3121
267	Great Britain #111/647. Dealer stock of almost exclusively mint hinged, moderately duplicated, accumulation of about 2500 stamps well displayed on 65 Vario brand stockpages. Most KEVII to mid QEII. Highlights include #133 NH, Royal Wedding high value #273 x3, booklet panes, definitive and commemorative issues with significant value. The layout indicates that there could be some finds for the specialist, especially in the KGVI and QEII Wilding definitives. A very special offering. Estimate =	$350.00	$190.00
2299
268	Great Britain #124. "Lombard Street" CDS cancelled example of the 1891 issue £1.00 green Queen Victoria, watermark 30 (3 x Imperial Crowns). Fine centering, tiny thin in margin at right noted for the record. 2023 Scott US$925.005=	$1,248.75	$140.00
6025
269	Great Britain #127/291. Homemade pages set up to develop a specialized collection of "The Kings", based on Stanley Gibbons numbers. At first blush, the pages might seem a bit sparse, and there is potential untapped value, as we have only catalogued the stamps as the basic issue. The KEVII issue has two mint examples each of the 5d and 6d and a single of the 9d. The GeoV issues to up to the 10d mint. The stamps are very lightly hinged. We counted 242 in total. 2021 Scott US$1457.90 =	$1,968.00	$60.00
5660
270	Great Britain #138, 138a. VF+ and exceptionally fresh examples of the two Scott listed shades of the 1902-1911 Edward VII 1 shilling value, consisting of the carmine and dull green (#138) and the scarlet and dark green (#138a) shades. Both are very LH (one possibly NH). 2023 Scott US$217.50=	$293.63	$65.00
2879
271	Great Britain #139-141. Sound and select quality VF used examples of the 1902-1911 period Edward VII 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine large format high values. All well centered with clear early CDS (#139 & 141) or mute Jersey (#140) cancels. A very pretty trio. 2023 Scott US$900.00=	$1,215.00	$160.00
6025
272	Great Britain #142. Sound and Very Fine centered used example of the 1902 issue £1 blue green Edward VII high value. Fuzzy but decipherable "GLASGOW" cancel. A very decent key Edwardian era stamp. 2023 Scott Classic US$825.00=	$1,113.75	$160.00
6025
273	Great Britain #205/2242 plus Regionals. Big bulging binders bearing 120 manila stocksheets that are straining under the load of thousands of used definitives, commemoratives and regionals from KGV to the early Millennium. Not all from the same source, these include medium to high values that are often not that easily found domestically and whose catalogue values add up quickly. Easily four thousand stamps in total. For the person with holes to fill and is looking for a hide and seek challenge. Estimate =	$150.00	$140.00
3208
274	Great Britain #224. Mint 10/- Seahorse from the last printing, with the cross hatching behind the portrait. A fresh, well centered example. Lightly hinged with 1 shortish perforation mentioned for the record. 2023 Scott US$375.00 =	$472.50	$375.00
4827
275	Great Britain #1839/2847. The second half of Lot 251, running from the Millenium issues up to 2010, with many large numbers of se-tenant sheetlets and souvenir sheets included amongst the used sets and singles. Many of the bigger pieces were soaked from first day covers, which in reality is the only way to obtain many of these issues used. There are about 900 stamps and at least 30 souvenir sheets included here, so there is still room for expansion. Don’t tell that to the Stanley Gibbons album which is straining under what it is already carrying. Very difficult to duplicate. Estimate =	$200.00	$400.00
6060
276	Great Britain #O3/O79. All used "sampler" of 34 different 1880s through early 1900s period overprinted government officials, including those prepared for Internal Revenue, Government Parcels, Army, Board of Education and Admiralty. Expect the odd small fault but a useful start to these important "Back of the Book" issues. 2023 Scott Classic US$3,200.75=	$4,321.01	$160.00
2299
277	Great Britain #O12. Rare mint example of the 1889 issue 1sh green high value from the Victoria Jubilee series with "I.R. OFFICIAL" overprint. Note album page adhesions on the reverse. Otherwise sound and Fine. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,100.00=	$1,485.00	$55.00
6087
278	Great Britain #O31-O36, O37, O38, O39-O43. All used selection of 13 different late Victorian and Edwardian era "GOVT PARCELS" official overprints. Usual heavy (parcels, remember) cancels on some values and expect the odd fault. All complete sets. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,962.00=	$2,648.70	$110.00
6025
279	Great Britain #O76. Scarce mint OG HR example of the 1903 issue 2½p green and carmine Edward with "ADMIRALTY OFFICIAL" overprint. A couple of perf tip toning spots noted for the record, only visible from the back. 2023 Scott Classic US$375.00=	$506.25	$110.00
6108
280	Great Britain - Accumulation of old revenue stamps and paper. If you like your collection to occupy the rear of the back of the book, then this old holding is for you. Spanning Queen Victoria to about 1980, with very little after 1970. Most are on stamp or piece, with stamps for Foreign Service, Diplomatic Service, every imaginable court service, express company. There are embossed revenue seals, and impressions for newspaper taxes on cutouts of Victorian-era newspapers. There are a handful of TV licences with the matching stamp. Quick summation, if there was something that needed taxing during these times, the British would make sure there was a matching revenue stamp. There are stock pages, a stockbook, glassines. Must be several hundred stamps. Includes a couple of older references (one is dated 1912!) to help you put order to this chaos. Estimate =	$200.00	$475.00
6243
281	Great Britain - Channel Islands Chaos in a broken-down stockbook! Stamps from Guernsey (#1/463), Alderney (#16/133a), Jersey (#181/599a) and Isle of Man (#8/258) each somewhat randomly organized and crammed into this stockbook, presumably to sort at a different time. We have tried to count the decimal-era postage value and came up with GBP123.33 = $206.00 CDN. This is undoubtedly an undercount and the used stamps, postage dues, etc were not counted at all. There is obviously some duplication and while the album has suffered, the stamps do not seem to have done too badly. Your organizing skills will be rewarded with this one! Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00
6466
282	Great Britain - Cinderellas, fantasy islands, stamp show sheetlets, in a huge offering that mostly covers the 1940’s-80s. Colourful issues that were conceived by creative minds and not listed by Scott catalogue. Includes Lundy, Davaar, Herm, Surf Island, Etats de Jersey, Calf of Man… The offering from Staffa includes a personalized album that includes some 23K gold stamps showing flags of various counties – with the original brochure indicating that these set the previous owner back over US$400.00 when issued. A number of the National stamp show sheetlets from the 1960's are present and there is even a printed album from the late 1960’s with about 40 stamps from Herm. The cost and effort to build this bundle would have been staggering. Estimate =	$200.00	$220.00
6025
283	Great Britain - Extensive Postmark Collection. Two small worldwide albums, repurposed to house an organized selection of over 1,200 used stamps (80% are 19th century issues) all sorted for the various types of post mark. The stamps are all Hinged on the pages, including various types of post office numbers, a London sub-office section, squared circles and decent range of various types of Circular Date Stamps. Offered intact as received, unchecked for better. There's more information on these cancels available with every passing year, including comprehensive online checklists and in-depth research articles. Here's a meaty introduction to a potentially very rewarding area of collecting. Estimate =	$150.00	$325.00
1496
284	Great Britain - GB stamps used in Channel Islands. 160 mostly QV & KEVII issues in old Stanley Gibbons binder with some pages and black stocksheets. The collector focused entirely on the quality of cancel (rather than the stamp), which are mostly Jersey and Guernsey, so expect some faults with the stamps (such as the 5/- KEVII). Still saw catalogue values up to $50 each. A very difficult grouping, which was put together over many years. Estimate =	$200.00	$36.00
6025
285	Great Britain - Jersey #7/927, J7-46. Dealers stock of 1300+ stamps on manilla stockpages. Up to five of an each and including 7 different souvenir sheets. All identified and catalogued by the owner. Owner's 2021 Scott US$745.30 =	$1,006.00	$36.00
2299
286	Great Britain - The last of a large holding of Channel Islands stamps from the wartime issues up to the early 1990’s. On album pages, auction cards, stockpages, new issues in their original glassines, off paper, loose. Both mint and used are well represented here. The collection covers Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man and a few regional issues to boot. Has not been picked in any way, the collector bought, set aside and forgot these items. Patience will be rewarded when sorting this one! Estimate =	$200.00	$160.00
5931
287	Great Britain - Alderney #1/127. All VF mint Never Hinged 1983 to 2001 period collection of over 120 stamps and souvenir sheets, all carefully housed in mounts on White Ace album pages or on stock sheets. Nearly complete for the period. High "new issue" cost. 2023 Scott US$194.20=	$262.17	$80.00
4453
288	Great Britain - Guernsey #426/658. All VF mint Never Hinged 1990 to 1999 period (plus some earlier mint & used) collection of over 380 stamps and souvenir sheets, all carefully housed in mounts on White Ace album pages or on stock sheets. Nearly complete for the period. High "new issue" cost. 2023 Scott US$393.90=	$531.77	$65.00
3501
289	Great Britain - Isle of Man #1/1706, J1-J24, J1a-J8a. All VF mint, 99% Never Hinged, 1958 to 2015 period collection (with extras) of over 800 stamps, souvenir sheets, booklet panes and complete booklets as well as postage dues, all carefully housed in mounts on White Ace album pages. 2023 Scott US$497.50=	$671.63	$140.00
269
290	Great Britain - Isle of Man #1/1993. Stanley Gibbons 5 volume regular album set with matching slipcases with owner-added top opening clear mounts. Houses a collection of over 1400 used stamps (about 90% complete) to 2004. After 2005, the issues become mostly mint, with the stamps having a face value of about UK£920.00 ($1536.00 CDN equivalent). Pages run to 2018, and the albums alone have a retail cost of over $650.00. Estimate =	$900.00	$325.00
4389
291	Great Britain / Channel Islands - A quirkily mounted collection of decimal-era Guernsey, Isle of Man and Jersey covering up to 1996. Fairly complete for the stamps, but with many of the souvenir sheets missing. What makes the mounting "quirky"? The collector took clear mounts and often mounted them with hinges! If there was a used copy of a stamp, it was often slipped into the back of the mount, backed onto its mint counterpart. We didn’t count any of the used stamps in the collection’s value and it doesn’t appear that any of the mounting has caused any harm. The "Guernsey" has a face value of GBP133.00, "IOM" GBP153.00 and "Jersey" GBP150.00. Conservatively valued at the face value only. A total of GBP436.00 =	$732.00	$100.00
4466
292	Great Britain Offices Abroad - Bahrain, Qatar, Morocco, EAF, MEF (plus a few others that don’t really belong), make up this accumulation of moderately duplicated material housed on 18 Vario brand stockpages. British stamps with overprints ranging from KEVII to early QEII, including Seahorse and KGVI issues to 10/- and a Royal wedding high value are noted. Most are mint hinged, with a few postally used. The material is very fresh in appearance, with individual items catalogue up to $100.00 each. Persistence will be rewarded. Estimate =	$180.00	$170.00
5724
293	Great Britain Offices Eritrea #11-33, J1-J10. Complete run of all the 1948-1950 issue "B.M.A. ERITREA" and "B.A. ERITREA" overprints on GeoVI stamps of GB. These were for use by British forces in post-war (and former Italian territory) Eritrea. All OG mint Hinged. Nice to get them all at once. 2023 Scott Classic US$451.30=	$609.26	$140.00
6482
294	Great Britain Offices Tripolitannia #1-33, J1-J10. Complete run of all the 1948-1950 issue "B.M.A. TRIPOLITANIA" and "B.A. TRIPOLITANIA" overprints on GeoVI stamps of GB. These were for use by British forces in post-war (and former Italian territory) Tripolitania. All OG mint Hinged. Nice to get them all at once. 2023 Scott Classic US$514.20=	$694.17	$190.00
5479
295	Greece #455/1673 plus some BOB. A remarkable collection of (mostly) post-war Greece housed in three SAFE dual hingeless albums with slip cases (one damaged). Almost complete to 1986, this collection includes all the better sets of the late 1940’s including #472/81, #539-44, C71-3. While a few stamps are very lightly hinged, the vast majority are carefully selected never-hinged, well centered and fresh examples. The 1330 different stamps speaks to its completeness, the photos will speak to its quality. You will wait a long time to get another offering like this. The retail value of the albums alone is over $400.00. 2021 Scott US$3002.00 =	$4,053.15	$450.00
6200
296	Greenland #9/40. A 1938-1956 selection of 15 used (4 different, including blocks) and 16 mint Never-Hinged stamps (6 different, including blocks). A premium "compact" selection, perfect for the collector looking to upgrade copies while having some powerful "traders" or the show / internet dealer looking to retail each item out individually. 2023 Scott US$798.25 =	$1,077.64	$130.00
3634
297	Heligoland #1/25. A wild offering of the German territory that was temporarily a British possession during the Victorian period. The various stamps depicting Queen Victoria in two different currencies were printed in multiple batches. Because of their relative scarcity and desirability, a number of reprints and forgeries were produced contemporarily, and dwarf the number of legitimate originals. This is an accumulation of 150 mostly mint examples that the previous owner was working hard at researching and identifying (comes with his notes). Despite the appearance of legitimacy for a small number of single stamps, this entire accumulation is being offered "As-Is". Estimate =	$200.00	$150.00
6025
298	Hungary #3/2077 plus BOB. Minkus pages stuffed with 1850 mostly used stamps with a good level of completeness for the period covered, including Newspaper, postage dues, officials, semi-postals airmails and the usual assortment of wild and wonderful overprints. Some cancel potential in the earlier issues. Overall, the condition and appearance is quite good. Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
6300
299	Iceland #45/272 B1-B4 C1-C2 O24/O44. Choice offering of 72 different stamps from the 1902-1951 period, all in Mint Hinged condition. A nice change to pick up a large offering of mint stamps from this ever-popular country. 2023 Scott US$453.55 =	$612.29	$60.00
2299
300	India #36 (x 2), 41, 42, 43, 44, 50, 52. Fresh and F/VF mint OG Hinged group of 1882 to 1895 period Victorian era issues. 2023 Scott Classic US$230.00=	$310.50	$140.00
4858
301	India #203-206. The fabled Mahatma Gandhi memorial issue of 1949, issued on his 80th birthday, a year after his death. Lovely clean, mint Never-Hinged. Check out the image of this set! A beautiful example of this key GeoVI era issue. 2023 Scott US$557.50 =	$752.63	$300.00
4224
302	India - Selection of India, Indian States, Pakistan, Bahawalpur. Neatly organized mint and (mostly) used duplicated stock of mostly Victorian era through mid-1950s issues from India proper (includes Officials, revenues and other "Back of the Book" material), a sampler of Indian States, some Pakistan, Bahawalpur and a smattering of other overprints on Indian stamps. Over 1,200 stamps in total. Unchecked for varieties or postmarks. A good lot for the Indian specialist. Estimate =	$250.00	$75.00
4858
303	India / Tibet - Group of 32 covers and a dozen Telegraph & Parcel forms postally used 1910-1960’s to Tibet, including some smaller towns. Very unusual, and not often seen material. From the old stock of a dealer who specialized in Tibetan philately. Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
3223
304	Ireland #1/1274. Collection covering Celtic collectors' needs from 1922 to 2001 housed on an assortment of album pages. Starts off with 1922 overprints to the 9d and continues with a mix of mint (hinged) and used issues into the 1970’s, which at which point it switches to many issues having both a mint never-hinged and used example. Many souvenir and mini-sheets from the 1990’s to the Millennium issues are included. There are about 1000 stamps here. The new issues have face values up to IRP5.00 each, with a total face value conservatively estimated at IRP320.00 =	$591.00	$325.00
4613
305	Ireland #1286/1801. Euro-era new issues covering most of 2001 to 2008, virtually untouched since they were first purchased. A total of 398 stamps (face values to 10 Euros), 3 booklets and 38 souvenir sheets. Very little duplication. Almost all are very fine mint never hinged, there might be a couple of souvenir sheets with a minor corner bend, mentioned "for the record". Conservatively valued for the total face value alone. Total face 389.07 EUROS =	$560.26	$280.00
6128
306	Ireland #J15-J21. Complete set of the 1971 issued postage dues (7 different values) in full sheets of 60 stamps, mint Never-Hinged. While each sheet looks like it was folded at one-time, there does not appear to be any perf separation (of very minor if there is). A tough set to acquire in sheet-form. 2023 Scott US$840.00 =	$1,134.00	$110.00
6255
307	Ireland - Irish Sweepstakes, for philatelists. An incomplete project lot awaiting your eagle eyes. Includes a few runs of old album pages, "on and off" paper kiloware, untouched bidboard auction lots and new issues in original sleeves. Several Irish Post Office Christmas "thank you" postal stationery-like cards. Most potential is 1922-60, including Searhorses #56-58 (10/- creased, all being attractive). Thousands of stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$260.00
4389
308	Israel and Palestine - Two collections from two adjoining worlds. Israel #208/627 & Palestine #1/84, J4/17. The Israeli material is mostly mint never hinged blocks, some with inscriptions, mounted on black Vario pages with a total of 771 stamps (owner's 2016 Scott US$254.80). The Palestinian material is earlier, in a little springback album with homemade pages. Some mint and used among the 86 stamps (owner's 2006 Scott US$219.05). Total Scott US$473.85 =	$639.70	$55.00
6087
309	Italy Trieste #14/207, C7/12, J1/29, Q14/24. AMG-FTT overprinted group of 109 mint stamps on 2 Hagner stocksheets, including better like J29 and pairs of the second parcel post issue. Most are lightly hinged, but a few are never hinged. All are in good condition. These overprints indicating "Free Territory Trieste" were added for a few years by the American Military Government to contemporary Italian stamps after the end of WWII. 2021 Scott US$557.40 =	$752.49	$90.00
3612
310	Latin America - A dozen countries represented including Haiti, Peru, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Ecuador, Hondouras, Argentina, Columbia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Chile and Bolivia. Over 400 mint and used stamps mounted on 15 Hagner stocksheets, with many pre-20th century classics noted. A mix of mint (hinged) and used, sometimes both. Each stamp or set is identified by Scott and includes its catalogue value. Some mixed condition, with any visibly damaged items are not counted in the total. Unchecked for better town cancels. Owner's older 2019 Scott US$1849.00 =	$2,496.00	$250.00
6311
311	Latin America - Honduras Guatemala and Panama. One collector. Three Latin American Countries. Not surprisingly with one style of accumulating material. There are mint and used stamps, by the hundreds, mounted on Scott Specialty pages, with overlapping content on Harris album pages, plus an assortment of loose material that the collector never got around to sorting out. Each of the accumulations starts out in the early years and is mostly finished by 1970. There are lots of interesting printings, overprints, BOB, topical interest. Honduras is the strongest offering, followed by Guatemala and Panama. Estimate =	$150.00	$270.00
6311
312	Latvia #B5/B91, C8/C13, CB1/CB20a. All mint selection of 43 different 1920 to 1933 issue "Back of the Book" issues, including Semi-Postals, Air Mails and Air Post Semi-Postal issues. All laid out on two Hagner brand stock sheets. Some NH noted but all valued as Hinged only. A clean and colourful offering. 2023 Scott Classic US$793.20=	$1,070.82	$180.00
3408
313	Latvia #CB3, CB4, CB18, CB20. Four different full mint NH panes of eight 1931 and 1933 issue Air Post Semi-Postal Stamps. Unfortunately, no complete sets here but the lot does consist of two values from two different sets. The first two (1931 issue 10s + 50s and 15s + 1l values) have a surtax for the Latvian Home Guards; the second two (1933 issue 3s + 53s and 35s + 1.35l values) have a surtax for wounded Latvian aviatiors. Full panes like these will be eye-catching and welcome additions to any exhibition page. The panes have been pro-rated for NH as per Scott (#CB3 & CB4 x a factor of 2; #CB18 & CB20 x a factor of 2.4). 2023 Scott Classic US$937.60=	$1,265.76	$110.00
6025
314	Latvia and Lithuania #1/67, 30/322 plus bit of Central Lithuania and BOB. Baltic neighbors haul from a dealer’s stock, housed on manilla stockpages, all identified and priced by Scott in 2005. A mix of mint and used in decent condition. Latvia is on 3 sheets, includes #13A, and was valued by Scott at $205.00. The Lithuania has two pages from the same dealer (Scott $134.00). There is an old holding of large blocks of mint Lithuania in good condition, that included some potential from the 1919 and 1921 issues. Noticed a block of 12 of #165. The lot finishes with a few loose pages with stamps of a Baltic theme. Estimate =	$160.00	$120.00
3408
315	Lithuania - Collection of stamps 1915-1937 on printed album pages, including the WWI German occupation OVPT set to 1m, the 1918-1919 provisional issues, airmail stamps and many better individual items mixed throughout. An interesting offering, in need of a sort by a knowledgeable collector. Estimate =	$140.00	$130.00
5742
316	Luxembourg #1/602 plus BOB. A collection of mint and used with heavy representation of the earlier issues, mounted on Scott album pages. The earlier material is identified and catalogued (see list of key items). A couple of the obvious reprints or forgeries are not included. Many of the better items look okay, however Scott notes that there are dangerous reprints from this time period and that expertization is recommended. For that reason, we are offering this collection "AS-IS". Owner's older 2019 Scott $3611.45 =	$4,875.00	$170.00
2060
317	Macao #517a/780. Se-tenants, souvenir sheets and booklets from the 1980’s-90’s, all in VF mint never hinged condition. Better includes #517a,559, 629, 655a, 572. These issues got caught up in the period where this Portuguese colony was reabsorbed back into China. Desired by collectors of Portugal, Hong Kong, China and Macau, let alone topical collectors. Macau had been a bit of a sleepy corner of the collecting world for many years, and produced issues in relatively small numbers which have held their value since originally catalogued in 1999. 2023 Scott catalogue value US$577.00 =	$778.95	$160.00
2879
318	Malaya Malacca #3/52. VF mint and all Never Hinged selection of 49 different 1949 to 1955 period issues, almost all in Post Office fresh complete sets. A great GeoVI and early QEII range of material. 2022 Scott US$230.05=	$310.57	$95.00
3408
319	Malaya States - Malacca #1-21, Penang #1-26, Perlis #1-27. Clean and fresh, very useful selection of 1948 to 1951 period issues from these three Malayan states. 26 different stamps from Malacca (Scott catalogue US$154.25), 26 different stamps from Penang (Scott catalogue US$99.15) and 27 different stamps from Perlis (Scott catalogue US$182.45) All the stamps are mint Hinged except for used examples of Penang #20, 21 and 22 as well as Malacca #12. All three states are complete for the GeoVI period. 2023 Scott Classic US$435.85=	$588.40	$160.00
3408
320	Malaya States - Pahang #30A/70, Perak #69/125. Clean and fresh, very useful selection of 1935 to 1950 period issues from these two Malayan states. 30 different stamps from Pahang and 40 different stamps from Perak in total with Scott catalogue values of US$196.40 and US$266.40 respectively. All the stamps are mint Hinged except for used examples of Pahang #64 and Perak #83. 2023 Scott Classic US$463.10=	$625.19	$65.00
2879
321	Mexico #3/1503, C2/491, E2/25, JX9/30 plus other BOB. An old holding with thousands of stamps crammed into manila stocksheets. An interesting range of used and mint issues, including some without overprints and a healthy offering of back of the book material (saw JX18 used). Last touched by the previous owner about 15 years ago, when each item was identified and priced by Scott. A quick check of the higher values indicate that they are still a close match to today’s Scott pricing. Condition is a bit mixed in the earlier issues. Owner's original older 2005 Scott US$3344.00 =	$4,514.00	$350.00
3939
322	Monaco #1/708, B61/99, C1/75, CB1/14, J1/64. Masses of madness from Monaco. A binder of manila stock pages barely contains this stock that has not seen daylight in years! Mostly mint hinged, a bit of used, up to 10-15 copies of some items, while only having a single example of others. Over 1000 stamps, with a significant number with individual values over $10 each. The previous owner identified each item by Scott number / 2005 catalogue value. A spot check of the better values indicates that it is an excellent match to the 2022 catalogue. Overall the condition looks decent. Owner’s original older 2005 Scott US$1392.00 =	$1,879.20	$95.00
5984
323	Mozambique #10. Sound, fresh and F/VF mint no gum example of the key 1877 issue 50r green "Crown" issue, in the original perf 12½ x 12½ (not a reprint). This is one of the scarcest 19th Century issues from this important Portuguese African colony. 2023 Scott Classic US$225.00 =	$303.75	$85.00
5742
324	Muscat and Oman #1-51, O1-O10. Complete run of all the 1944-1954 issue overprints on GeoVI stamps of GB and India. All OG mint Hinged. While there are a couple of faulty stamps in the lot (from heavy Hinging) it's still nice to get them all at once. 2023 Scott Classic US$235.80=	$318.33	$110.00
5241
325	Nepal - Postal stationery holding of mint, used and CTO postal cards, old dealer stock numbered and priced by Wateren (1995) and unchecked by us. Includes 10x WA37 used, 13 mint copies of reply card WA40 and 7 used message halves from the same reply card. Card WA42 is well represented with a number of Everest or Katmandu CTO cancels on 32 cards. There are 5 copies with printed cachet for the visit of Juan Carlos, and 40 copies printed for the visit of Helmut Kohl. Finally WA43 has 9 uncut strips of 4 postcards, each CTO. A fascinating lot. Originally priced by the dealer over 25 years ago at $1080.00 CDN. Estimate =	$140.00	$46.00
3634
326	Nepal / Tibet - Postal History / Stamps etc. An 1900-1980 accumulation of both from Tibet and postal history that travelled between Nepal and Tibet. These philatelic mysteries include stampless folded letters, 45 assorted covers, stamps (probably forgeries or reprints), and woodcut block impressions from 1900-1980. A wide range of usages, rates, and different destinations. Assembled from the stock of a dealer who specialized in the philately of Tibet. There could be some finds here for the diligent researcher. Estimate =	$200.00	$55.00
6025
327	New Zealand #6/1963A. Five volume Stanley Gibbons collection in burgundy padded covers and matching slip cases, with regular pages to 2013. The previous owner added clear top opening mounts which house a few hundreds mostly used stamps. There aren’t a lot of stamps after 1990. Scott catalogue numbers have been penciled in, beside the Stanley Gibbons numbers. The value is in the albums, which would set you back about $650.00 at today's retail prices. Estimate =	$250.00	$120.00
5841
328	New Zealand #31/216, B3-4, C1-5, O11, OY29-36. Hagner page of South Pacific beauties. Starts with some attractive Chalons (#34 not counted), 9 examples of the 1d "Sideface" issue with ads on the back, the Auckland Exhibition overprints on the 1/2d KEVII, the 1d Dominion and a complete Dunedin Exhibition set. The 1936 definitives (second printing) is missing only a couple of cheap values and is never hinged! Rounding out the group are some "Smiling Boys" (1 mint, 1 used), Airmails and Life Insurance issues. 2021 Scott US$781.15 =	$1,055.00	$110.00
3612
329	New Zealand #52/1161, B1/B145 plus Ross Dependencies. Enjoy hunting through this fine offering of 1600 stamps! Primarily used for most of the first century, with a good representation of the QV era including a postally used example of #98 (the 5/- Mount Cook), with an Auckland registered CDS cancel (cat $400.00). The KEVII and KGV definitives are clean and mostly complete. More recent issues include #B1-2, #301, #402-3. In the 1970’s, the collector switched back to almost exclusively mint issues, where there is about $100.00 NZ face value, including individual values to $10.00. Also included is the 1970-1971 Year Pack and 13 stockpages of duplicates. Estimate =	$350.00	$130.00
163
330	New Zealand #218/1154, B8/138, OY29-56. Collection of 840 NZ stamps mostly from the latter half of the 20th century, mostly mint, and hinged until the early 80s. Better individual items include #403-404, Captain Cook, Health souvenir sheets and Life Insurance isses. There is a very good representation of mint new issues from the late 1970’s into the mid-90’s including higher values like the $10 Kiwi. Very little duplication. There is about NZ$305.00 in face value alone from the decimal period ($250 Canadian Equivalent) and the total catalogue value for this offering would easily exceed $1000.00. Estimate =	$250.00	$230.00
6311
331	New Zealand #B14/B126a. Semi-postals issues on homemade quadrilled pages with black mounts are home for this collection of 106 stamps & 43 souvenir sheets. The souvenir sheets are complete for the first decade of issue and followed by a less complete showing thereafter. A couple of the early souvenir sheets are hinged, and the balance appears to be never-hinged. The only duplication is where the collector has put singles to complement the souvenir sheets. Lots of topical interest here for sports, birds, royals, animals. 2021 Scott US$422.30 =	$570.10	$65.00
6104
332	New Zealand - A charming revenue explosion in a 16-page stockbook. Starts with QV stamp duty issues, followed by hundreds of long QV postal fiscals, with denominations up to 35/- (up to 200 of a type). The "Arms" postal fiscal issues are well represented, with many postally used examples mixed in, including a 5/- Official overprint (there is a second copy, but it is damaged). The best examples are fiscally used copies of the 2 pound 10/- and 3 pound 10/- arms, but free of any punch holes. Postally used examples of these stamps are almost impossible to find, and this is the next best thing. There is a smattering of 30 copies of the last ($4-$10) Arms issues unchecked for printings. Finally, there are 110 copies of various Social Security revenues with overprints covering 1935-1958. A not often seen holding. Estimate =	$350.00	$230.00
6255
333	New Zealand and Tokelau #36/911 plus BOB and 20/152. King brand stockbook with 48 pages housing a collection of 700 New Zealand stamps starting with 6 Chalons up to 1/- and the QV sidefaces (some SON cancels) it then settles into a solid collection with a good example of most stamps, missing only the higher values. The Tokelau selection includes a mint and used offering of 170 stamps, most in complete sets. Both countries end their runs in the early 1980’s. Estimate =	$180.00	$110.00
5719
334	Nyasaland Protectorate #51-94, J1-J5. Complete mint Hinged run of 53 different 1937 to 1951 period GeoVI issues including key plates, pictorials and postage dues. All have been valued as the basic printings/shades by Scott. The odd small fault to be expected from hinge removal. 2023 Scott US$393.75=	$531.56	$90.00
2712
335	Pitcairn Islands #1/191a. Very-close-to-complete offering of mint and VERY lightly hinged from this Pacific outpost’s first quarter century. Includes the "A" numbers, the Royal Wedding and the Common Design issues. Clean, fresh, well organized on old stockbook pages. Amongst the 215 stamps and 5 different souvenir sheets, there is a bit of duplication, including a complete duplicate of the first set, including the "A" numbers. 2021 Scott catalogue value US$422.00 =	$569.70	$55.00
5933
336	Poland - Box of collections and accumulations that got started, but never finished. Loose album pages, a stockbook, stockpages, dealer pages, even six mint sheet files filled with sheetlets of mostly sporting and art stamps from the 1960’s and a few from the mid-1990’s. Also, a variety of airmail stamps and covers. There is potential postmark interest from the earlier issues and so much to explore. Estimate =	$160.00	$95.00
5841
337	Russia #26/3090 plus BOB. Old Schaubek "Soviet Union" album with pages to 1940 featuring a bit of "feast or famine" as the pages are either filled or empty. This collection is nicely supplemented with a dealers stock on pages, cards, glassines and even a couple of old approval books. The biggest potential here is from the Czarist period, as there are desirable issues from the 1930’s such as C37-9 (used). Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
5614
338	Russia - Post-breakup USSR cover lot, of mostly postal stationery envelopes, used in the early 1990s. All sent to Canada with short-live, inflationary, rates, services (saw a couple Express/Special Delivery), even local revaluation-overprints. A total of 63 covers. This modern Eastern European collecting field hasn’t been appreciated for its complexity and the lack of contemporary documentation of these issues. A number of these envelopes contain their original contents. Estimate =	$130.00	$11.00
2060
339	Saint Pierre and Miquelon #2/250 plus BOB. Collection of 143 stamps with a strong showing of overprints from the 1891 and 1892 issues and good representation of the fishing issue. Mint and used throughout, with many nice CDS cancels noted, housed on cut-down album pages, as received. Some semi-official and postage dues round out this quality offering. A good starting point for someone looking to expand their French Colonies, Newfoundland or even Canada collections or for an established collector to cherry-pick some nice stamps to upgrade their collection. 2023 Scott US$675.75 =	$912.25	$160.00
6363
340	Scandinavia - Bundle of approval books that were made in the early 1950s and then don’t appear to have seen much action in the 70+ years since. Priced by Facit (1951) with some possible finds for the specialist. Most are used and there is a bit of duplication. There are about 173 stamps from Sweden between 116/165 with some better officials. The Finland offering of 120 stamps ranges from 49/180, B1/B106, the best being clean used examples of the earlier semi-postals. Finally the Norway concludes with about 170 stamps, including some of the higher value "V" overprints, such as #236-238 used. If you like manageable old time finds, this is for you! Estimate =	$250.00	$85.00
5295
341	Scandinavia - Norway 132/1689 and Sweden 230/2570, both with a bit of "back of the book" material. A nice used collection of over 3000 used stamps, mostly post-war, mounted on ruled pages. Many clear, readable cancels and very complete for both countries (with only a few souvenir sheets noted). After year 2002, the collector didn’t get around to mounting any new acquisitions, and put them in envelopes, by year, up until about 2011. The second part of the lot is a used dealer’s stock solely of Norway on 20 manilla stocksheets that covers much of the same period. Has up to about 10 copies of each stamp. Easily 5000-6000 stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
6466
342	Scandinavia and Netherlands - Blue Unisafe 48-page stockbook hosts this Northern European accumulation that looks to have hidden value with each turn of the page. Faroes, Iceland, Denmark (including Danish West Indies), Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Starting about 1900 and running up to the early 2000s, most stamps are used with a number of nice cancels noted. Some mint souvenir sheets, booklet panes and "back of the book" as well. A bit of duplication to be expected. Over 2,000 stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
6486
343	Seychelles #122/190. Nearly complete (missing only the 1953 QEII Coronation commemorative #172) and almost all mint Hinged (only #123 & 140 are used) run of 1937 to 1956 GeoVI and QEII period issues. The bulk of the value is in the long pictorial sets. All laid out on three Hagner brand stock sheets. 2023 Scott US$568.50=	$767.48	$210.00
3408
344	Sierra Leone #152. Spectacular used example of the 1£ KGV high value from the 1932 issue. Nice light pair of Freetown CDS cancels. Very difficult to get postally used and in such clean condition. 2023 Scott US$275.00 =	$371.25	$150.00
3683
345	Singapore #1/1663. A very thorough offering 1227 used Singapore stamps from 1948-2015 in two volumes, all housed in clear mounts. Includes perf and watermark variations, souvenir sheets and most of the better issues. Only a handful are needed to complete this collection and most of what is missing relatively recent issues. Condition is remarkably clean with no obvious faults noted. 2021 Scott US$1630.34 =	$2,201.00	$210.00
4686
346	Singapore #107/163. Early 1970’s mint, nearly complete offering of 64 stamps. Bought by the previous owner as new issues and includes souvenir sheet #141a (bit of usual minor bending), these sets are surprisingly difficult to obtain. Note #158 with a pulled perf and not counted in the catalogue value. 2023 Scott US$381.30 =	$514.75	$55.00
2879
347	Solomon Islands #14/1000. Almost all mint (H/NH) lightly duplicated 1908-2005 period selection of 312 stamps and souvenir sheets, all laid out and identified on Hagner stock sheets. Lots of WWII topicals in the more recent issues. 2022 Scott US$411.30 =	$555.66	$55.00
2060
348	Solomon Islands #66/87, J1-J8. Nearly complete run of all the 1937 to 1951 period GeoVI issues, (missing only #76). All either mint Hinged (most) or used (a few). The lot includes the scarce 1940 postage due set of eight. 2023 Scott US$190.20=	$256.77	$46.00
6269
349	Straits Settlements #14/271, B2. Mint and used selection of 128 almost all different 1867 to 1948 period issues, all laid out, organized, identified and valued on two Hagner brand stock sheets. Noted complete sets, different Dies, shades and better singles. Could be better cancels or specialized varieties lurking! 2022 Scott US$410.35=	$553.97	$90.00
5435
350	Switzerland #41/398, B1/333, J21/54, 2O7/2O52, 3O13/3O102, 4O2/4O28, 5O17/5O22, 7O21/7O33. The first century of Swiss postage, represented by 1100 stamps mounted on old album pages. Lovely clean, mostly used stamps with readable cancels throughout and only the occasional duplicate. Fairly complete and many better items noted, including #96, 97a, 98-100, 181-5, 200-3, 246, 376-7, B10-11, B18-20, B25-28, B57-60, B80, B144. This collection was catalogued back in 2015. In the meantime, the values of earlier used Swiss stamps, including the early semi-postal issues has risen considerably. This has more than offset some slight softening of prices for mint stamps of the same period. We are confident that the catalogue value for this collection is a good representation of today’s pricing. Owner's older 2015 Scott US$3236.00 =	$4,368.00	$475.00
4064
351	Switzerland #181. VF mint NH example of the 1914 issue 3 francs Prussian green "the Mythen" high value pictorial. This is the key early 20th century Swiss issue and extremely hard to find this nice. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,150.00=	$2,902.50	$500.00
77
352	Thailand #632a/1930. Dealer’s stock of 80 souvenir sheets, often in both perforated and imperforate version, individually identified by both Scott and Michel #s. Better include #632a, 684a. In F/VF never hinged condition and with significant coverage from 1972-1990.

Lot #	Description	Cat. Val./Est.	Price Realized
1	Aden States - Post-independence and before becoming Yemen, these regions produced stamps that were derogatorily referred to as "Sand Dune" issues, but have gained respect over the years, particularly from Topical collectors. Noted JFK, Churchill, Olympics, Space, Art and the near-unique “clothed Goya” (we wish we were kidding). This lot is mostly complete perforated sheets, with one batch of imperf sheets and oodles of single imperfs. Most are in perfect condition and most in even numbers of complete sets. The standard number for each issue is three sheets of 25 stamps. Most are identified by Michel, as they are not listed in Scott. Saw Quaiti State (Coronation set is 75 stamps, cataloguing 35 Euro a set!). The Kathiri State has Churchill, Japanese Art, JFK, Flight, Olympics (both perf and imperf). The sheet portion ends with 4 different issues from Mahra state. Then there are a number of glassine envelopes with imperf gummed single stamps from many of these proceeding issues and a number that didn’t appear in sets, to which we have given a nominal catalogue value. Total 2024 Michel catalogue value €15,000! =	$21,900.00	$375.00
6025
2	Andorra French Administration #1/248, B1, C5-8, P1. Mint collection on black pages, including #52, 54, 122-3, 136, 138 and a number of Europa Common Design issues. A total of 152 different stamps. The earlier are generally lightly hinged, the later issues mostly never hinged. Excellent, fresh appearance with broader appeal to the collector of France, French colonies (and administrations) or Western Europe. 2023 Scott US$931.80 =	$1,257.93	$110.00
2299
3	Andorra French Administration #3/181, P1. Assortment of 31 mint blocks of four strikingly attractive and these can help break up your album pages with a bit of a mixed look. Well centered, a couple with some minor aging and a couple with minor perf separation. 2023 Scott US$281.60 =	$380.16	$34.00
2299
4	Andorra French Administration #14/175, B1, C3. Lovely offering of 14 Fine to Very Fine used singles from French Andorra’s earlier age of issuing stamps. Includes #14-18, 21, 37, 41, 136-7, 174-5, B1, C3. 2023 Scott US$566.00 =	$764.80	$80.00
4741
5	Andorra French Administration #23/244, B1, C5-7. Clean mint offering of 110 stamps on 2 Hagner stockpages being a mix of lightly hinged and never hinged. Better items include #41, 52, 53, 54 as well as some Europa issues from the 60s. Good as a starter group, or for filling some spaces in your collection. 2023 Scott US$640.50 =	$864.65	$85.00
163
6	Andorra French Administration #J14-J15. Duo of key high value postage due stamps, issued 1931-1933 in Fine / Very Fine condition, with nice clean cancels. 2023 Scott US$345.00 =	$465.75	$42.00
3097
7	Andorra French Administration - Two red dealer boxes, packed with "102 cards", housing a dealer’s stock. Probably around 1800 cards, with most having 1 stamp per card (also noticed a number of blocks). Probably 90% plus of the material is fresh mint, with a mix of lightly hinged / never hinged. Moderate to heavy duplication but most are the stamps are pre-1960 with individual catalogue values up to about $20 a stamp. Identified by both Scott and Michel numbers. There has to be over $3000.00 Scott catalogue value here. Unfortunately, the retail prices marked are unrealistic, and we have not taken them into account in our estimated value. Estimate =	$250.00	$375.00
4466
8	Andorra Spanish Administration #1/290, E3. Good range of 115 mint issues ranging up to the early 2000s. Noted #19 and #24, each heavily hinged with a pulled perf and with the Key Europa issue (#62) lightly hinged. Most are lightly hinged in the earlier period, eventually shifting to become never hinged. Not often seen material for this little corner of Western Europe. 2023 Scott US$476.50 =	$643.30	$70.00
3408
9	Antigua #21/136, MR1. An attractive mint selection on black stocksheet which includes 45 different hinged stamps, with strength in the Seal of the Colony and Harbour issues, #28, #30 (pulled perf, not counted cat $115.00), #38, #41, #55-56, Royal Wedding high value (only stamp in the lot that is never hinged). Some minor faults to be expected, including a bit of aging on the earlier issues. 2023 Scott US$818.35 =	$1,194.75	$180.00
163
10	Australia #8/162, C1-3, O1. Great appearing selection of 41 mint pre-1940 stamps, including Roos up to a £1 "Specimen" (#57) and some nice KGV "Heads" alongside a mixed smattering of Australia’s earliest commemorative issues. The earlier material is fairly heavily hinged and some faults are to be expected. As the material gets more modern, the hinging also becomes lighter. Still nice clean material. Without counting the Specimen, the Owner’s 2023 Scott US$1056.75 =	$1,422.60	$220.00
6493
11	Australia - Multiple odds and ends, which eventually resulted in the creation of a lot. In this case there is a page of 42 used "Roos" and "Heads" with OS perfins (SG as cheapest is £268.00). Loose album pages with some potential early regular issues, 10 mint booklets, group of 1970s new issues and packs (face AUD $50.00) and 10 mint NH sets of the Antarctic Territory "food chain" set. The lot finished with a M&U mounted collection, mostly from the 90s with lots of mint stamps hinged in place (an additional face value of AUD $276.00). A few "States" issues got sprinkled in too. Estimate =	$250.00	$95.00
5124
12	Australia - Premium Mint Mix 1970’s to 2000’s accumulated by a collector over a number of years including presentation packs, dealer cards, on pages and loose. Noted many better packs, complete booklets (including Prestige booklets), booklet panes, gutter pairs, souvenir sheets and high-values (up to $20.00 AUD face value). A couple of items duplicated, but also includes a showing of Antarctic Territories, Christmas Island and Coco (Keeling) Islands. There is a smattering of used (and a couple postcards / first day covers) not counted in the following total. Conservatively valued at the face value alone, while there are plenty of "premium" items. Total face value AUD$806.84 =	$715.53	$325.00
5734
13	Australia - New South Wales #88a. The 1890 issue 20sh ultramarine "Captain Phillip and Lord Carrington" high value, perf 11x11. Fresh and Fine mint full OG, LH. 2023 Scott Classic US$450.00 =	$607.50	$140.00
3223
14	Australia - Northwest Pacific Islands #3/46. Before it became Nauru and its natural riches were understood, this island group became an interesting philatelic sideline as an Australian administered territory. The overprints on the Roo and KGV Heads issues were both exotic, but also included different challenges for collectors. This holding includes examples of both major overprint types with a variety of watermarks and some nice cancels. A few of the lower value "Heads" are mint, the balance used. Some minor duplication and expect the occasional fault. 2023 Scott US$360.50 =	$486.65	$120.00
163
15	Australia States - A quartet of states issues. Includes South Australia #64, 115, 154 (noting an official "SA" perfin), Queensland #70a and 3x #44 used, New South Wales #82c, 119, O24 and Tasmania (probably the strongest in this offering) #57a, 76, 88 (x2), 89, 92. The Tasmania also boasts #AR10/14 printed on a thin card stock overprinted "REPRINT" as the real issues would catalogue in at $2000.00. Finishes with 4 pages with 45 Tasmania issues, many of which have readable town cancels. A grand total of 68 stamps which would catalogue about US$900.00 PLUS the reprints. Mint are in the usual mixed, often heavily hinged condition of the era. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
3223
16	Bahrain #1/80. Used overprints on Great Britain stamps issued in the KGV/KGVI period. Selection of 20 different stamps with a number of key issues including #13-14 (couple of nibbled perfs), #31, #41, #55-56, KGV to 5R, KGVI to 25R, Royal Wedding high values. 2023 Scott US$564.50 =	$762.10	$70.00
6136
17	Bhutan #33a/1052, AR1-4. Interesting array of VF Mint never hinged stamps on black Vario brand pages. Includes #33a, the Imperf souvenir sheet, with control #000001 on the back (the first one printed!?!). #98-98B WITHOUT the overprint and an array of topical issues with World Cup Soccer, Trains, Stamp on Stamp themes, usually with their matching souvenir sheets. 2023 Scott US$424.05 =	$572.50	$80.00
2712
18	Bhutan #152-152F. Complete set of seven record playing stamps! Produced in 1973 as a novelty issue, these continue to hold collector’s fascination. These are never hinged, and probably have never been played. There are videos that can be found on YouTube where people are playing them...and the sound is better than what you might expect! 2023 Scott US$461.50 =	$623.00	$280.00
6396
19	Bhutan - Small box of odds ‘n sods. The best is the handful of about 30 new issue presentation folders from the early 1970s and two complete sheetlets from the printed (but not issued) 1976 Colombo issue (the highlight in the map showed more India than Bhutan and was rejected). There are aslo some fiscals and a small bundle of 1 Ng banknotes. Estimate =	$170.00	$85.00
6025
20	Botswana / Ghana - Nicely organized mint and used duplicated stocks of two 20th century independent African countries, Botswana and Ghana. The Botswana material consists of 322 stamps and souvenir sheets, 1966 to 2002 period issues with a Scott catalogue value of US$552.65. The Ghana material consists of 342 stamps and souvenir sheets, 1957 to 1995 period issues with a Scott catalogue value of US$233.00. A useful mix of topicals and scarce postally used items. Total 2022 Scott US$785.65=	$1,060.63	$120.00
4466
21	British Africa - Balance of an estate. Includes selected Central/Southern Africa. The classic period includes Cape of Good Hope (some attractive Revenues noted), Griqualand West (several overprints that we will let you pass judgment on), Uganda, Southern and Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland. The more modern includes Ciskei, Venda, Transkei. These are on album pages, dealer cards, and just loose. Many hundreds of stamps. Estimate =	$160.00	$220.00
5931
22	British Africa - Revenue stamps or revenue usages. Selection of 27 mostly used including overprints, perf cancels, dedicated revenue stamps and high value postal issues with revenue cancels. High value in Barefoot. Clean appearance but will have usual odd fault as often found with these types of usage. Estimate =	$200.00	$55.00
6025
23	British Central Africa #3/70. Terrific offering of 21 mint hinged and used stamps on black stockpage. Includes #27 (owner’s mark), #51, 53-54. Also included, but not counted in the catalogue value are the lovely high values #55-56, #59 which have revenue cancels (these three alone catalogue $3100.00, and will fill that space until a postally valid usage comes along!). 2023 Scott US$858.75 =	$1,159.30	$210.00
5900
24	British Commonwealth - A largely Arctic / Exploration themed selection of 23 First Day Covers, mostly from the 21st century bearing sets and souvenir sheets from Ross Dependency, St Helena, South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha. These stamps are tough to find used (an understatement), so collectors often find these First Day Covers as the next best thing. Catalogued for the stamps only, with no premium for FDC. 2021 Scott US$248.70 =	$335.75	$325.00
6493
25	British Commonwealth - Grand total of 1,040 sound and F/VF mint NH, mint H and used stamps, all housed in dealer #102 cards, with values up to $20.00 noted. The lot contains: Malawi 98 stamps, $96.45; Malaya, Malayan States & Malaysia 424 stamps, $472.55; Maldives 37 stamps $36.70; Natal 48 stamps $144.95; Nauru 107 stamps $86.10; New Guinea 33 stamps, $35.80; Nevis 26 stamps, $22.70; and Newfoundland 267 stamps, $337.70. Note that many of the price valuations are older and in many cases have not been updated in many years. Total catalogue value US$1,230.95=	$1,661.78	$220.00
6466
26	British Commonwealth - Modern Royal Family common design collections. Includes 1972 Silver Anniversary, 1977 Silver Jubilee and Princess Anne’s Wedding. Includes "common designs" as well as additional design issues from many other countries. About 400 stamps and 80 souvenir sheets loaded in a 24-page brown Unisafe brand stockbook. Supplemented a second Lighthouse binder (with slipcase) containing an accumulation of more modern Royal covers, cards and cancels commemorating Royal Visits and Birthdays (these up to about 2011). Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
269
27	British Commonwealth - Red box, 80% full of 102 cards, making up the balance of a dealer stock. Includes Middle East (Aden, Bahrain, Kuwait), British America (Antigua, Falklands British Honduras) and Pacific (Gilbert & Ellice, Hong Kong, Tonga). Minor duplication, but usually 1 stamp per card, mint and used, much is common, but we saw values up to $25 a stamp. Well identified by Scott and often Stanley Gibbons with any faults noted on the card. The dealer pricing was unrealistic, which we have ignored. Estimate =	$180.00	$130.00
6466
28	British Commonwealth - St. Helena #115-138; Tristan da Cunha #1-12. All F/VF mint Hinged complete GeoVI 1937 to 1951 period selection of St. Helena sets, both pictorial and commemorative as well as the overprinted first set of St. Helena. 2023 Scott Classic US$230.40=	$311.04	$75.00
6286
29	British Commonwealth - THREE red boxes, with a total of about 1300 "102" cards being another balance of a vest-pocket dealer’s inventory of British Africa & Mediterranean countries. Includes Crete, Cyprus, Egypt, Gold Coast, KUT, Niger Coast Protectorate, Nigeria, Northern Nigeria, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Zululand plus a scattering of others. Lightly duplicated, with usually 1 stamp per card, mint and used, QV to early QEII. Mix of common and better, with catalogue values up to about $30.00. Accurately identified by Scott and often Stanley Gibbons, with an honest assessment of condition. Alas, the dealer was so unrealistic in his pricing that very few items ever sold, which was a shame as there are nuggets scattered throughout his material. Estimate =	$180.00	$350.00
5691
30	British Commonwealth - Three stockbooks with wide range of material, from a wide range of countries. Most of the earlier is used, with later issues up to the 1990s being mint (often never hinged). Noted singles, sets, souvenir sheets and a number of early to mid-Elizabethan booklets. Strength in Caribbean (British Virgin Islands, Barbados, St. Vincent), Africa, Pacific (Pitcairn, Norfolk) and Tristan da Cunha. No Great Britian or the "Dominions". Likely 2000 stamps here, with sets valued up to about $50.00 each. Stockbooks are all white-pages inside, with Unitrade 2x 16-page and a 32-page Lighthouse brand, all in good condition. Expect some duplication. Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
6486
31	British Commonwealth - Two modern Royal Family "common design" collections for Queen Elizabeth’s 2002 Golden Jubilee (151 stamps, 56 souvenir sheets) and her 80th birthday in 2006 (41 stamps, 31 souvenir sheets). These 21st century sets had enormous face value and were bought as part of a package, complete with album and Hagner pages. Likely a substantial original purchase price. Estimate =	$150.00	$140.00
269
32	British Honduras #16/134. Lovely selection of 16 postally used examples including #16, 24, 67. Overall, these stamps have a good appearance with nice cancellations. 2023 Scott US$392.25 =	$529.50	$55.00
6136
33	British West Indies - Mint and used material from Jamaica (#33/179), British Guyana (#107/298) and Barbados (#90/253). A mixed mint and used duplicated collection of 408 stamps from these three Caribbean countries, mostly beginning in 1902 and continuing up to independence. The British Guyana begins a bit earlier. Nicely laid out in Vario brand stock sheets with year sets clearly identified. Small faults to be expected but generally a good quality lot, lightly cancelled where used. Includes some colour and perf varieties. One page of British Guiana duplicates at the end could generate further finds. A nice start to these West Indian countries. Owner's 2011 Scott US$905.00=	$1,221.75	$100.00
6321
34	Brunei #17/228. Three stockpages with mostly mint hinged making up this collection of 148 stamps. Includes the 1924-37 River issue and a number depicting the Sultan and some common design sets. Fresh, attractive material. Scott US$430.25 =	$580.80	$70.00
2712
35	Canada #2TCv. Trial Colour Proof of the six pence Consort in grey on india with vertical SPECIMEN in orange. A lovely sound and fresh Pence issue item. 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$260.00
5112
36	Canada #8Pi. VF quality proof on india in colour of issue of the ½p rose Victoria (vertical SPECIMEN in green black). A lovely Pence era piece. 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$210.00
5112
37	Canada #8TCii. Sound and F/VF example of the 1857 issue half penny Victoria plate proof in black on india paper with vertical "SPECIMEN" overprint in carmine. 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$210.00
5112
38	Canada #12. Faulty (reperfed on at least two sides) and repaired example of the rare 1858 issue perforated 3p beaver, extremely light cancel. A great looking "spacefiller" until you can find nicer. 2023 Scott US$1,400.00=	$1,890.00	$150.00
4261
39	Canada #14/517. Collection purported to have been owned by William G Rennie (famous Seed business family). Alas no postal history here, but there is a decent collection of 700 mostly used stamps remounted on an exploded black page Lighthouse stockbook. Noticed 1c & 15c Large Queens plus lots of Small Queens and "Widow Weeds" to 50c, 6c & 8c Jubilees, Numerals to 20c, Quebec to 5c, Admirals, mint Cavell, Destroyer and Ferry dollars. 2023 Scott US$3090.00 =	$4,171.50	$425.00
5112
40	Canada #15/657. Only used in the earlier issues, this largely mint collection of 450 stamps is mounted in a CWS "Slip-EZ" hingeless album with padded binder and matching slipcase. The used includes some faulty Cents issues, Large Queens to 15c, Small Queens to 10c and a 50c Widow Weeds (total catalogue value of the used is about $1000.00). The mint includes an 8c Jubilee, QV Leaf issue to 8c, Numeral to 7c, EDVII to 7c (each of the three sets has the 5c value with no gum), Quebec to 5c and then many lower values of the KGV sets, including lots of coil singles and the "Ferry" and "Fish" dollars. Many of the mint stamps are indeed never hinged, but many of the earlier issues are off-centre. The mint portion has a conservative catalogue value US$2795.00. With the collection having a total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$3795.00 =	$5,123.25	$220.00
6492
41	Canada #19P. Brilliantly fresh and VF quality proof of the 17c Cartier in the blue colour of issue without "SPECIMEN" overprint. Printed on india paper on card. 2023 Unitrade =	$300.00	$400.00
6493
42	Canada #30e. Mint part OG Hinged example of the rare and distinct deep blue shade of the 15c Large Queen. The paper is lightly toned, otherwise sound. 2023 Scott US$2,500.00=	$3,375.00	$375.00
6108
43	Canada #34/2040. Used stock on a few hundred manila stocksheets, packed into a bankers box. Thousands of stamps from QV Small Queens to the issues of the early 21st century (up to about 2004). A labour of love was put into these stamps, which would have taken MANY hours to soak, press and arrange on these pages. The pages alone are worth a fair penny! Estimate =	$200.00	$280.00
6076
44	Canada #34/832 plus Back of the Book. Don’t judge a collection by its cover. An inauspicious photo album holds Scott brand pages with added black mounts which were re-holed to fit a three-ring binder. What the collector didn’t spend on their album they put into their approximately 1000 stamp collection. Noted Small Queens to the 10c, most of the Jubilees up to the 50c, complete Leaf, Numeral, KEVII, Quebec and then very complete until about 1980. Includes some better OHMS/G overprints as well as Special Delivery issues. Bit of duplication (with none of the duplication counted in the catalogue value. 2023 Scott US$3722.00 =	$5,024.70	$270.00
5841
45	Canada #35/2072 plus BOB and Newfoundland. Large Unitrade album covering 1851-2005. Over 700 stamps, including some better such as the QV 10c Numeral, 10c Quebec (damaged, with a nice SON cancel), the key dollar values from the KGV period (Parliament, Cavell, etc) and a Bluenose. While the collection definitely slows down by the 1990’s, we noted about $50.00 face value in more modern issues, mostly booklets or panes. Album is in good shape and retails at $95.00 alone. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00
6466
46	Canada #36. Fresh and F/VF mint NH example of the 2c green Small Queen (shade tending towards blue green). Pristine and unblemished OG. 2023 Scott Classic for NH US$200.00=	$270.00	$95.00
5112
47	Canada #43. Fresh and F/VF mint OG example of the 1888 issue 6c red brown Small Queen. Attractively centered, nice impression. Never Hinged but with a pinpoint spot of gum disturbance, so valued as Hinged. 2023 Scott US$225.00=	$303.75	$170.00
6032
48	Canada #50. Fresh and VF mint NH example of the 1897 issue ½c black Queen Victoria Jubilee commemorative. Attractively centered, sharp impression. Unitrade is $450.00 for VF mint NH. 2023 Scott US$275.00 =	$371.25	$65.00
5402
49	Canada #50/60. Mint Hinged and used selection of 1897 Jubilee issues. The ½c to 5c values are all mint H; the 20c and one 50c are both mint H but thinned; the last two stamps, the 10c and the other 50c are used. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,252.50=	$1,690.88	$42.00
6274
50	Canada #50P, 51P, 52P. VF vertical imperforate proof pairs (on card) in colour of issue of the ½c black, 1c orange and 2c green 1897 QV Jubilees. An eye-catching trio, with two of the pairs sheet margin examples. Prime quality items from the famous ABNC Archives sale and a great start to a set of Jubilee proof pairs. 2023 Unitrade =	$440.00	$200.00
4791
51	Canada #51. VF mint NH upper left sheet margin corner block of four of the 1c orange 1897 issue Jubilee. Unitrade is $480.00 for four VF NH singles. 2023 Scott Classic US$300.00=	$405.00	$60.00
5869
52	Canada #51, 52, 53. Choice VF mint NH examples of the 1c orange, 2c green and 3c bright rose 1897 issue Jubilees. Unitrade is $390.00 for the VF mint NH trio. A fantastic start to a Never Hinged set. 2023 Scott US$242.50=	$327.38	$42.00
6274
53	Canada #51/60 Used Selection. All used lightly duplicated selection of 1c (x 3), 2c (x 2, 3c (x 4), 5c, 8c, 10c, 15c (x 2) and 50c QV 1897 Jubilees, all laid out on one Hagner brand stock sheet. Generally VG/Fine with some small faults to be expected. 2023 Scott Classic US$879.00=	$1,186.65	$36.00
6274
54	Canada #52i. VF mint NH upper left sheet margin block of six of the Unitrade listed deep green shade of the 2c QV 1897 Jubilee issue. A few minor wrinkles noted for the record. A pretty little Jubilee showpiece. 2023 Unitrade =	$600.00	$80.00
5869
55	Canada #54. Post Office fresh, perfectly centered and VF mint NH example of the 5c deep blue 1897 Queen Victoria Jubilee issue. Pristine and unblemished original gum. Worthy of the finest collection. Untrade is $300.00 for VF mint NH. 2023 Scott Classic US$200.00 =	$270.00	$95.00
6012

If "Back of the Book" material interests you, this is the lot you want! While you can expect some fault in a lot of this type, the total catalogue value will still be in the thousands.

6012
211	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #13Pi, 13Pii Combination Variety. The 12½c black "SPECIMEN" overprinted proof pair with rare and dramatic plate flaw. A stunning vertical pair mounted on card, showing overprint types B and C se-tenant. The pair is from positions 48 and 58 and shows the most spectacular flaws that occur on this plate. The upper left ornaments are almost completely missing on both proofs. Exceedingly rare, as this pair can only occur once in the sheet, so fewer than 15 exist. A Very Fine showpiece.

3634
218	China - PRC #1479/2516. Mixture of mint never hinged complete sets and the occasional souvenir sheet (includes #1844, with an ever-so-slight gum bend) from the last couple of decades of the 20th century.

1837
222	Cyprus #4/135. Octet of better early Cypriot stamps, mint (hinged) or used. Includes QV overprint and the two highest values of the KGV issue. 2023 Scott US$309.50 =	$417.15	$55.00

6493
230	France #13/101. A 19th century assortment of 57 mostly used stamps assembled on a black stocksheet including notable stamps from the Bordeaux printings. All but two stamps in the lot are used, including some with striking cancellations.

Many of the used stamps could also use a soaking, which would greatly improve their presentation. 2023 Scott US$1417.20 =	$1,913.20	$210.00
5595
231	France #15/27. Wholesale study lot of 20c and 40c values from the "Franc" issue, both imperf (116 copies of #15, and 65 copies of #18) and perforated (93 copies of #26 and 43 copies of #27).

6300

6025
241	Gilbert and Ellice Islands #5/55, J1-J7. Superb mint selection of 17 different singles, all Mint lightly hinged, with the exception of #31 which has its sheet margin and is never hinged.

4389

4904
250	Great Britain #1/517 plus BOB. Bounty to be found in this worn 1960’s Oriel Stanley Gibbons 2-post album in a battered slipcase with quadrilled pages.

251	Great Britain #3, 4. Scarce numbered Maltese cross cancellations. Examples of #1/12, missing only #4 and #11, with 53 copies of Scott #3, and 7 copies of Scott #4. Some faults expected as the cancels were the focus... but there are some beautiful stamp/cancel combinations. Listed in Gibbons at a substantial premium for these scarce Head office (London) cancels at over £12,000 For the basic stamps. We have not seen a lot of this quality before. Estimate =	$1,000.00	$650.00
6108
252	Great Britain #3/13. Used early QV "Penny" and "Tuppence" selection of 10 stamps, chosen for either being attractive stamps or nice cancels including a pair of #13 with a nice Liverpool cancel. Usual mixed condition with a few minor faults. 2021 Scott US$650.00 =	$877.50	$55.00
2951
253	Great Britain #3/1946 plus BOB. A 32-page stockbook about 2/3 full with 1700 stamps, but overstuffed with potential.

3969
254	Great Britain #3/291 plus BOB and Regionals. Sparsely populated Stanley Gibbons album with nice black mounts added containing 210 mint and used stamps. Strengths are almost everywhere in the QV era with single stamps cataloguing $100 each throughout, including three Seahorses and lots of socked on the nose cancels. Most appear to be in better than average condition. Value throughout as evidenced by the total catalogue value. 2021 Scott US$3865.00 =	$5,217.75	$260.00
3208
255	Great Britain #5a / 6. Pair of difficult QV higher values. The 1/- is a close-cut, but full example, used with a Chingwell London cancel. The 10p is overprinted "SPECIMEN" and is cut to shape, with a trace of original gum and hinge remnants Stanley Gibbons prices this at £3000.00/$5000.00 CDN (presumably as not cut-to-shape), so we have cautiously catalogued these both by Scott. 2021 Scott US$1450.00 =	$1,950.00	$80.00
5898
256	Great Britain #7. VF used example of the 1854 issue embossed 6p red violet, with "VR" watermark (wmk 19). Margins well clear on all sides. Small margial nick at top noted for the record. A rare early Victorian issue. 2023 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,350.00	$120.00
6484
257	Great Britain #33/120. Attractive grouping of 10 QV issues, but all with minor fault (more than suitable to fill the spot for now and replace later), including #33 (plate 155), 58 (plate 6), 100, 105 (thin), 116-120. 2021 Scott US$1338.50 =	$1,807.50	$28.00
6484
258	Great Britain #27. The 1856 6d lilac mint QV stamp with no gum and a straight edge at the left, but with a nice "SPECIMEN" overprint. Stanley Gibbons prices this at £600.00/$1000.00 CDN (@1.67). 2021 Scott catalogue value for the regular stamp is US$1400.00 ($1890.00 CDN). Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
3121
259	Great Britain #37. Mint OG HR example of the 1862 issue 3p pale rose Victoria, watermark 24 (Heraldic Emblems). Straight edge at left, otherwise sound and Fine. An extremely rare stamp in mint condition. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,900.00=	$3,915.00	$150.00
3266
260	Great Britain #43 - Plate #10. Sound and F/VF mint no gum example of the 1865 issue 4p vermilion Victoria, watermark 23 (Large Garter). Plate 10 is the scarcest plate of this stamp. 2023 Scott Classic US$850.00=	$1,147.50	$100.00
6484
261	Great Britain #45. Plate 6 - top row copy, from position "AE". A very good/fine mint copy (perfs are a bit tight on the right hand side). Original gum but heavily hinged with a bit of minor toning. Still an impressive mint stamp for the period, missing from most collections. 2021 Scott US$3700.00 =	$4,995.00	$150.00
1837
262	Great Britain #53. The 1867 10d red-brown mint QV stamp with only a trace of original gum and a straight edge at the left, but with a nice "SPECIMEN" overprint. Stanley Gibbons prices this at £500.00/$835.00 CDN (@1.67) while Scott catalogues the regular stamp at US$3500.00 ($4725.00 CDN). An interested "extra" item for your QV collection. Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00
3266
263	Great Britain #57 Plate #1. VF centered "Sock on the Nose" CDS used example of the plate #1 type of the 1867 issue 5sh rose large format Queen Victoria, watermark 26 (Maltese Cross). Razor sharp "STOCK EXCHANGE JU 19 '74 EC" cancel. Tiny areas of light scuffing at bottom noted for the record. Still an exceptional looking high value GB Classic.

3773
264	Great Britain #73. Mint QV 8d orange issue from 1876 with a trace of original gum and a light "SPECIMEN" overprint. Bit of minor soiling, but an elusive item. Stanley Gibbons prices this at £350.00/$485.00 CDN (@1.67) while Scott catalogues the regular stamp at US$1750.00 ($2863.00 CDN). Estimate =	$150.00	$42.00
3121
265	Great Britain #96, 108, 109. Sound and F/VF used trio of large format 1883-1884 issue high values, consisting of the 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine. All very well centered with moderate cancels. Conservatively valued, without any of the premiums added for centering or CDS cancels (as per Scott footnotes). Some paper staining on the 10sh value (mostly visible from the back). 2023 Scott US$1,090.00=	$1,471.50	$85.00
3266
266	Great Britain #114/761 plus BOB and later Machins. Collection on Lighthouse hingeless pages up to 1975 (missing one post in the Turn-bar binder and inexplicably the first 13 pages from the start of the QV era) but including a nice selection of late QV to early QEII issues, mostly hinged. Includes KGV-KGVI definitive sets, QEII commemorative phosphors, Castles, etc. There is multi-level appeal here as the album retails over $700! There is 30 pounds face value in later Machins (values up to 5) which were not counted in the catalogue value. 2021 Scott US$850.00 =	$1,147.50	$190.00
6217
267	Great Britain #118a. F/VF mint part OG Hinged example of the rare Type I (squarish dots beside "d") printing of the 5p lilac and blue Victoria from the 1887-1892 "Jubilee" series. Missing from most collections we see. 2023 Scott Classic US$925.00=	$1,248.75	$75.00
2271

Includes a couple copies of certificates from where a single originated from a block. Mostly hinged, but some are never hinged. Take a good look at the pictures to appreciate all this lot entails. Well beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized £2157.00 =	$3,602.20	$210.00
6255
269	Great Britain #128e/228a. Selection of King Edward VII (1) and King George V (9) booklet panes as part of a specialized "Kings" collection. Includes SG #219a, 351c, 420e, 420ew, 436c, 441ew, 441fw, 455a (2). Most are lightly hinged and have the usual trimmed perfs with some minor perf separation in places. Lot also includes a complete 2/- booklet with 12 remaining stamps, 2 ads from four different panes, all the cover advertising and interleaves and a cover from the 1935 Jubilee booklet. This specialized material is not covered well in Scott. 2017 SG Concise £816.00 =	$1,362.70	$90.00
347
270	Great Britain #159/172. Lower denomination KGV profile head definitives issued between 1911-1924 are covered in this specialized offering of 370 stamps. Includes all variations in colour, shade, watermark and perf varieties with a pleasing mixture of singles up to larger blocks. We also noted some control and plate numbers. Very clean and mostly hinged lot. Well beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized catalogued. Gibbons 2015 catalogue value £3325.00 =	$5,552.75	$240.00
1837
271	Great Britain #173/224. Specialized Seahorses! Selection of 26 used stamps, missing only the £1 denomination, with four printings represented. Overall, these stamps have cleaner than usually seen cancellations and the stamps are in far better than average condition for these KGV-era high values. 2021 Scott US$3650.00 =	$4,927.50	$210.00
2168
272	Great Britain #179. VF mint OG VLH example of the 1919 Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co. printing retouched 2sh6p olive brown KGV Seahorse (22.5mm-23mm vertically). Great centering and perfs. 2023 Scott Classic US$175.00=	$236.25	$85.00
6484
273	Great Britain #185/223. Three commemorative issues from the KGV era (British Empire Exhibition, PUC (no pound) and the Silver Jubilee issue). A total of 81 stamps showing control and plate numbers in singles to larger blocks being a combination of hinged and unhinged. Beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized. Total 2015 SG catalogue value £745.00 =	$1,244.15	$150.00
3208
274	Great Britain #210/220. GeoV low-value photogravure definitives issued between 1934-46 make up this specialized collection of 178 mint stamps. Nice offering showing examples of different formats, colours, watermarks and perforation varieties. With singles mixed in with multiples and showing some control and plate numbers. Clean mint offering. Well beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized catalogue. 2015 SG £901.00 =	$1,504.65	$290.00
6052
275	Great Britain #230/233. King Edward VIII specialized collection mounted on homemade pages. Includes most of the control and plate numbers listed in Gibbons but not Scott. Includes inverted watermarks and post office training strips. A very difficult to duplicate effort, with a total of 124 mostly mint hinged stamps.

3208
276	Great Britain #230a/284b. Selection of 34 Edward VIII and George VI booklet panes as part of a specialized "Kings" collection. Includes inverted watermarks, differing spacing and a variety of advertising. Most are lightly hinged and have the usual trimmed perfs.

347
277	Great Britain #234/275. KGVI definitives, Coronation and Penny Black Centenary commemoratives. A specialized offering of 438 mint (mix of hinged and never hinged) mounted on homemade pages. Includes coil starter tabs, plate numbers and plate varieties. Of particular note, we noted a nice #251 indigo, lightly hinged. Bonus are some interesting related Cinderellas (not counted). Well beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized. Total Gibbon catalogue £2172.00 =	$3,627.24	$425.00
6142
278	Great Britain #258/291, J26/J38. Enormous specialized collection of the "pale" and "new colour" KGVI issues issued between 1941-51, comprising of 423 mint stamps. Noted plate varieties like "seven berries" and "crown flaws" plus a number of control letter and plate number issues as listed in Gibbons. We noted some coils, training stamps and 16 postage dues from the same era. Well beyond the scope of Scott, so listed by the previous owner’s 2015 SG Specialized. Total Gibbons catalogue value £2779.00 =	$4,640.95	$425.00
6142
279	Great Britain #1713/2606. Modern used collection covering 1997-2008 (no Machins). Includes 980 used stamps hinged to pages in Elbe springback album, with most of the sets being complete. The cancels are clean and no obvious faults were seen. Because these are postally used stamps, there are very few of the souvenir sheets of the time period. To offset that deficiency, 42 mostly different addressed first day covers overlapping most of this same time period, including some Machin booklet panes. Overall, fairly comprehensive coverage with very few faults and very little duplication. The effort and cost to duplicate this offering would be significant. Estimate =	$180.00	$130.00
5907
280	Great Britain #O28, O29. Sound used examples of the 1883 to 1886 issue 6p and 9p values, both with "GOVT PARCELS" official overprints. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,950.00 =	$3,982.50	$75.00
5742
281	Great Britain - Channel Islands - Alderney Intact Booklets. Archival "new issue" VF quality selection of 19 different intact and unexploded booklets, 1994 to 2014 period, the majority being the premium "Prestige" types.

These booklets were issued in very limited numbers compared to GB or Guernsey booklets. The total face value of all 19 booklets is £180.55=$305.00 CDN. Exceptional artwork and topical subject matter. 2023 Scott US$465.00=	$627.75	$95.00
3613
282	Great Britain - Exploded Machin booklet lot from 1987-90 in a pair of 22-ring Stanley Gibbons binders mounted on homemade pages. Definitely a specialized undertaking, with many pane and cover variations noted. Includes GV1a, GK4 (cover variations), HB1. There are notes indicating that the collector felt that there were scarcer printings that hadn’t been recognized by catalogue makers. The 1st and 2nd class rate stamps bump up the face value from their original selling price. Note: Some of the later booklets were left intact. Total face value £437.12 =	$730.00	$425.00
6108
283	Great Britain - File box of misfit stamps. Includes 9 stockbooks and albums with a wide range of mostly 20th century Britain. Noted a SG Windsor springback with some early KEVII & KGV low denomination mint including #142 x2 and 3 of 4 British Empire Exhibition. There are 3x 16 page stock books, with a nice range including about 100 Guernsey/Jersey WWII era stamps that were the start of a study and a nice accumulation of regional issues and used postage dues. There is also collection of mint and used Isle of Man on homemade pages, a page of Framas, Morocco overprints, PHQ cards and a handful of Machin FDCs 1970-1990’s. Strength is definitely in the Elizabethan era. Estimate =	$200.00	$150.00
3969
284	Great Britain - Masses of mint Machins. All decimal era, up until about a decade ago. Most appear to be never hinged. Includes a few packs, booklets and some Regionals. Face value to £5, with light duplication. There has been some attempt to put order to this, with additional large amounts of loose material. Conservatively valued at the face value alone. Total face value £284.85 =	$475.70	$375.00
5435
285	Great Britain - Mint Millenium and mini-sheet madness. From two collecting philosophies. Turn of the 21st century British new issues nicely laid out on pages, with some new issue material in its original envelopes (Face value £103.34). It’s opposing twin was a cautionary tale about why speculation in philately rarely works out in the long run, as the collector purchased 123 of the "Castles London ‘80" souvenir sheets (#834a), including a "plating guide" identifying the 9 plate positions for each of these souvenir sheets (paid $145 in 1982! and not counted here). Followed this up with 80 sheets of the Rowland Hill souvenir sheet (#874a). These both combined have a face value of £93.11. All together, these make up a lot of VF clean Mint Never-Hinged material. Conservatively valued at the usable postage / face value only. Total face value = £196.45 =	$328.05	$140.00
6108
286	Great Britain - Modern Mint / Prestige Booklets / FDC assembly. A often tough to assembly modern group of material including BK188 (Charles Darwin), London 2010 "Making of a Masterpiece" Machin booklet, #3568-3573 Christmas (2016), David Bowie self-adhesive singles, #3678 Royal Wedding souvenir sheet (#3678), Roger Hargreaves illustrated panes (#3556a / 3561a), 2009 "Post Box" issue FDC (with two different illustrated cancels), #2471 Machin souvenir sheet (two FDC and one presentation pack), 2006 Animal Tales FDC, 2007 Machin anniversary souvenir sheet FDC and three different 2010 "London Festival of Stamps" souvenir sheet FDC's. An attractive grouping. 2022 Scott US$221.10 =	$298.49	$40.00
6475
287	Great Britain - Trio of SAFE Dual albums being luxurious burgundy leatherette 14-ring binders and matching slip covers, with hingeless pages for commemorative issues between 1980 and 2004. There are hundreds of used stamps on the pages, up to about the year 2000, and very sparse afterwards but the value is in the albums. Because one of the albums has had the rings detach from the binder cover, we have not counted this in the retail value of replacing these albums from SAFE, with a retail value of US$875.00 or $1180.00 CDN. Estimate =	$300.00	$110.00
3208
288	Great Britain - Jersey #1/319 plus BOB. WWII occupation to 1983, this near complete collection of 628 stamps is housed in an attractive Lighthouse hingeless album with a green binder and matching slipcase (Original retail was about $300).

4533
289	Great Britain Channel Islands - Old school Scott Specialty album with original dust jacket (bit torn but significant eye appeal) with pages up to 1983 houses a collection of Channel Islands, including the GB regional issues. Noted Guernsey (1/273, J14/J29, catalogue value of $110.00), missing the 1969 set (including the album page), then Jersey (1/315, J7-16, catalogue value of $125.00, again missing the first set) and Isle of Man (1/249, J1/J16, catalogue value $120.00). Stamps are mostly mint never hinged, mounted in black mounts. As a bonus, there are over 50 pristine blank Scott Specialty pages for whatever your collection desires. (The Scott binder and the refill pages, alone, retail over US$100!) Around 700 stamps in total. 2021 Scott US$455.00 =	$614.25	$120.00
6486
290	Great Britain Channel Islands - The classic trio. Guernsey (8/249, J14/J29), includes the early "a" values from the first set, with a catalogue value of $155.00, Jersey (7/309a, J13/20, catalogue value of $122.00) and Isle of Man (12/218, J9-J16, catalogue value $81.00). All in a Stanley Gibbons Simplex springback album with homemade pages running to about 1982 with the 650 stamps mostly in black, top-opening mounts.

5495
292	Hong Kong #1/121. Used assortment of 27 better early used Hong Kong including #53, #79-81. Noted a few Treaty port cancels amongst the QV issues. Overall condition is good with the stamps being visually very attractive with only a couple of minor faults noted. 2020 Scott US$648.00 =	$874.80	$70.00
5742
293	Iceland #35/236, O14/O43. Selection of 59 different stamps from the 1902-1941 period, mostly with CDS cancels. A nice selection of used stamps, largely from pre-WWII period. 2023 Scott US$348.30 =	$470.21	$42.00
5103
294	India #1/222, BOB plus States and States BOB. The morass from Madras. An assortment of 28 mostly used stamps, includes #15, #35 "Specimen" overprint (heavily hinged), #97 and #166. The early QV issues include a fake of #1, and possible reprints of a couple of its sister issues. The #6 was amazingly NOT cut to shape, but then got a bite taken out of it in the past 150 years. A couple of the States issues would need some expert attention. Regardless of any individual issues, there is lots of great value here. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3121
295	India #203-206. Choice mint set commemorating what would have been the 80th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, issued 1949 in memoriam a year after his death. Extremely lightly hinged, the previous owner actually thought that it was a never hinged set and we can understand why. Lovely clean, mint, and as fresh as it looks! A beautiful example of this key GeoVI era issue. 2023 Scott US$557.50 =	$752.63	$250.00
4224
296	India and States - Almost everything India in a medium sized box! Includes the remnants of two dealer stocks and an old time States collection. Thousands of mint and used stamps, almost all pre-1960 including some cancel interest of India issues used in other countries (e.g. Aden, Persia, etc.), noted some revenue paper, possible overprint varieties and a number of mint multiples from the KGVI definitives. Lot of good old fashioned value in every nook and cranny. Estimate =	$250.00	$625.00
4858
297	India States - Cochin #41/101, Travancore-Cochin #8/13 plus Back of The Book. Mint and used selection of 72 stamps, 1933 to 1945 period issues, all still Hinged on the original Stanley Gibbons album pages. All identified and valued by the owner.

1315
300	Italy - Offices, Colonies and Occupations Stock. Duplicated stock, with a grand total of 1,317 sound and F/VF mint NH, mint H and used stamps, all housed in dealer #102 cards, with individual values up to $37.50 and sets up to $33.00 noted. The Italian material proper runs from Scott #1000 and goes up to #2791. The foreign Offices and Colonial issues are from a dozen different entities. Note that many of the price valuations are older and in many cases have not been updated in many years. The lot includes a hand-written inventory list. Total Scott catalogue value US$2,414.60=	$3,259.71	$170.00
2299
301	Jamaica #7/460. The remnants of an estate including album pages and stock cards from QV to the early 1960’s. Includes singles, sets and random higher values such as #141 (both a mint and used copy). Some good cancels in the early period. Hundreds of stamps, in a state of chaos. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00

Saw Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cuba, Haiti, Panama, El Salvador, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay. Most cards contain just a single stamp with about 3/4 of the material being used. Appears to be all pre-1970 and included back of the book material. Your job will be made easier in that most of the items have been identified but never priced. Lots of common stamps but did see individual items cataloguing up to $10.00. Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00

304	Macao #6/323, C3-5, RA1-3. Smattering of early classic Macau on a black stockpage. The condition of these 24 stamps is a bit mixed, with some heavy hinging evident. A few of the stamps are "no gum as issued" and #43 has some minor album offset. Still a very attractive grouping from a very popular collecting area. 2021 Scott US$569.10 =	$768.30	$110.00
1073
305	Macao #337/431. Selection of mid-century mint key-values. All 18 stamps are lightly hinged with many notable stamps including #347A, the high value from the "flowers" issue and the "Map of the Colony" issue, missing only the cheapest stamp. All fresh and attractive, from this popular former Portuguese colony. 2021 Scott US$306.25 =	$413.44	$32.00
1073
306	Macao #404/885. Pair of black stockpages filled with 1960’s-90’s sets, all VF Mint never hinged. Includes the "Soldiers" issue, "Gambling" set and Lunar issues. A total of 94 stamps, most in full sets (just missing the souvenir sheets). 2021 Scott US$361.25 =	$478.69	$65.00
1073
307	Malaya and States - Selection of 16 better used singles. The highlights includes Malacca #34, 73. Johore #168, Negri Sembilan #4, Penang #96, Straits Settlements #201, Trengganu #15, 42. 2021 Scott US$470.00 =	$634.50	$110.00
3408
308	Malaya and States - Selection on stocksheet of 79 mint stamps, the best being from Johore with postage values to $2 values and a nice block, then Kedah (oxen) and the Labuan overprints on early Straits Settlements issues. Backs range from hinge remnants to a few that are never hinged. 2021 Scott US$452.00 =	$610.20	$100.00
3408
309	Malaya and States, Brunei and Singapore - The good, the bad and the ugly in a dealer’s stock on 102 cards. The good feature a few hundred stamps, individually housed in enough 102 cards to half fill a "red box", each properly identified by Scott and Stanley Gibbons with faults honestly listed. The bad being most of the stamps are common, but we did see the occasional item with 2021 catalogue values up to $40.00 a stamp including a Singapore 1948 Royal Wedding high value used. There is some cancel potential throughout and even a touch of Japanese occupation issues. Some duplication, with about 95% being used. The ugly being the dealer’s retail prices were so far removed from reality that they are to be completely ignored, which we have (for everyone's sake). Estimate =	$160.00	$200.00
6466
310	Malaya Federated States #11/73. Selection of 5 "Elephant" high values, all appearing to be postally used. Includes #11 (short perf, crease), 14, 34, 35 (faulty, but a nice "Camp Office" cancel) and #73. Better than average condition for these large, high denomination stamps. 2021 Scott US$772.50 =	$1,042.90	$42.00
6274
311	Netherlands #90-100. VF CDS used short-set (missing only the elusive 10g value, #101) of the 1913 Centenary of Dutch Independence issue featuring the Kings and Queens of Holland. 2023 Scott US$164.75 =	$222.40	$120.00
3612
312	Malaya Johore #8/168. Selected select offering of 6 mint and used better values. Mint includes #8, 65, 67 which are hinged. The trio of used includes #75 which we are counting as a revenue usage, but looks like it could pass as being postally used (difference in catalogue value is $60.00 vs $1000.00!), 83 and #168. 2021 Scott US$330.00 =	$445.50	$95.00
4224
313	Malaya States - Selection of Sets and Singles. Mint and used organized group of 1895 to 1962 period issues, all laid out on Hagner brand stock sheets. 324 stamps in total with a Scott Catalogue value of US$1,595.50.

Excellent range of issues including better sets with very little duplication. Total 2022 Scott US$1,595.50=	$2,153.93	$180.00
6255
314	Malaya Trengganu #44. VF used example of the 1921 issue $5.00 red and green on yellow large format high value, watermark 3 (multiple crown and CA). 2023 Scott Classic US$425.00=	$573.75	$190.00
4189
315	Malaysia Area - Malaya, Malaysia, Singapore, Straits Settlements Selection. Mint and used semi-organized duplicated stock of various Malaya States including Singapore, Straits Settlements, Malaysia proper and other sundry issues. Much is neatly laid out on Hagner stock sheets. Unsorted extras not counted in the catalogue value. Over 400 stamps total, 1904 to 1965 period. Total 2022 Scott US$430.70=	$581.45	$50.00
6255
316	Malta #3. Shade study of 8 mint, or unused early 1/2d QV perf 14 issues. All of the stamps are hinged, a couple have no gum whatsoever and 3 or 4 just have just a trace of original gum. The Mint and Used have about the same catalogue value. The Scott ctalogue lists 4 different shades with significantly different catalogue values, we have offered this as a study group valued at the lowest possible catalogue value. Plenty of upside for the astute collector wanting to identify them further. 2021 Scott US$720.00 =	$921.00	$60.00
5742
317	Malta #3/45. Mint and (mostly) used 1863 to 1911 period selection of 37 different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on one Hagner brand stock sheet. Lots of nice CDS cancels noted. 2023 Scott US$810.40=	$1,094.04	$130.00
4613
318	Malta #9/222. Selection of 23 mint values from QV to KGVI. Includes #14 (no gum, not counted) and #39 5/- KEVII (a bit toned). Some of the earlier issues are heavily hinged, including with remnants. Still an attractive and worthwhile lot. 2021 Scott US$592.75 =	$800.25	$85.00
6035
319	Nepal - Disorganized hodge-podge of a couple thousand mint and used stamps primarily from the 1910-1970 period. Some items of interest are the occasional better value and some relatively common overprinted items marked as "Counterfeit" which surely have a story behind them. An unpicked remnant from a dealer stock. Potential value at every turn! Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
3961
320	Nepal - Postal stationery dealer’s stock. Hundreds of items (including many duplicates), most identified by van der Wateren. Includes mint, used, postally and cancelled to order (often with commemorative cancels). The postcards include at least 30 mint examples of the first issue of postal cards, with notes from the dealer attempting to properly identify them. The envelopes are strong in the 1980’s and include some earlier issues. The aerogrammes go back to the early issues and could form the basis for a specialized collection. Finish off with three postally used registered envelopes, with some charm. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
3634
321	New Zealand #61/67. 1882 QV Sideface issue in F/VF black plate proofs in margin blocks of four. All on unwatermarked stamp paper, similar to what they were released. Eye-pleasing showpieces and more affordable than the regular issued stamps. Estimate =	$400.00	$130.00
2168
322	New Zealand #165-170. Post WWI Victory Issue set of six imperforated plate proofs. Printed in the colour of issue on a white, unwatermarked, gummed paper. Some heavily hinged, others barely hinged. Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
6269
323	New Zealand - Box of mostly mint fragments that adds up to a lot of value. The best is a pair of mint sets being the 1935 (second printing) and 1940 Centennial. Includes lots of souvenir sheets (noted Cook issue, 6 mint NH, 1 CTO), B52a-B53a x3 sets, Zeapex s/s x50! Also includes a couple of complete 1960s booklets, a Zeapex presentation booklet, 1989 year set and a few partial panes from the 1970’s. The lot finishes with a collection fragment with lots of mint (face value NZD $396.80) and used stamps hinged to pages. Estimate =	$250.00	$160.00
5495
324	New Zealand and Dependencies - KGV Admiral issue high values. Group of 11 different mint examples including the basic New Zealand set with additional shades of the 2/- and the OFFICIAL overprint (#182, 182a, 183, O56), Cook Islands, with both Rarotonga and Cook Islands overprints (#74, 74a, 75, 101, 102) and Niue which didn’t have a 3/- overprint (#47, 47a). Mix of hinging, so best to presume that all have minor hinge remnants and then be surprised when a few end up being better. 2021 Scott US$563.50 =	$760.73	$70.00
5691
325	Niue #70-103. All F/VF mint Hinged complete run of all the 1937 to 1950 GeoVI period issues. The lot includes all the high value overprinted postal/fiscals. 2023 Scott Classic $489.60=	$660.96	$190.00
6286
326	North Borneo #23/296, B6a/B41, J1/J49. Amongst the world’s most beautiful stamps. A mint offering of 117 stamps. Includes some imperf singles, BMA overprint to $2, the semi-official Rhino perf 15 and some KGVI blocks to round things out. Most of the mint stamps are hinged, with #23 being unused (no gum). 2021 Scott US$1218.10 =	$1,644.40	$230.00
3097
327	North Borneo #35/295, B41, J1/J31. A used offering of this always-popular corner of South Asia highlighted by #256-258, but including a solid offering of 140 used stamps on stockpage, some with town cancels (not often seen). Overall condition is good with only the occasional small fault to be expected. 2021 Scott US$483.85 =	$653.20	$80.00
3097
328	Norway #50/1381 plus Back of the Book Stock. Duplicated stock, with a grand total of 3,725 sound and F/VF mint NH, mint Hinged and used stamps, all housed in two long red boxes in dealer #102 cards, with individual values up to $6.00 and sets up to $7.25 noted. Note that many of the price valuations are older (2016 and earlier Scott) and in many cases have not been updated in many years. Total Scott catalogue value US$2,466.25=	$3,329.44	$300.00
6087
329	Papua New Guinea #1/445. Two pages from different eras. The first page includes the universally loved Lakotai issue, including "Papua" overprints, most mint hinged with a couple that are used (catalogue value US$292.00). The second page contains modern Mint NH sets including the Butterflies and the Seashells issues (catalogue value US$85.90). Total 2021 Scott US$377.90 =	$510.17	$75.00
6321
330	Pitcairn Islands #67/191. Dealer holding or a "new issue client" with a penchant for duplication? These issues cover 1967-79 and included everything from single stamps up-to 5 sets (often including blocks) and up to 10 souvenir sheets of an issue. Fairly complete for the period including #97-109, 146, 150A and 176a. All in very fine Mint, never hinged condition. These were pulled from their original envelopes, as purchased decades ago. 2021 Scott US$423.05 =	$571.10	$55.00
5495
331	Reunion #4/254, B3/B15, C2/C26, CB2-CB4, J2/J7. Mint and used duplicated stock of 634 stamps, both regular and "Back of the Book" issues. The lot includes sets up to US$88.10 and singles up to US$62.50. Very useful range of material for both the collector and dealer. 2020 Scott US$1,580.65=	$2,133.87	$220.00
5984
332	Rhodesia - Choice selection of used stamps. Check out the Kasama CDS cancel on #12! Just one example of the quality to be found amongst these 33 used stamps (#19 has a revenue punch cancel and is not counted in the catalogue value). 2021 Scott US$497.20 =	$671.20	$70.00
6279
333	Sarawak #1/211. Charming offering of 57 mint stamps ranging from the Brooke family to the QEII definitives. The earlier issues are mostly heavily hinged, the later mostly lightly hinged. The three stamps at the bottom of the page have no gum and there is a forgery of the inverted imprint (all of which are not counted). The three multiples on the second page add a nice change of pace on any album page. Scott US$607.25 =	$819.79	$70.00
4612
334	Sarawak #9/218. Selection of 42 stamps and forgeries. A trio of fascinating forgeries gets this lot started, one was so widespread that it is mentioned in the Scott catalogue (the giveaway was that the overprint in question never existed) with the other two being fake inverts. If you just want regular issued, cleanly used examples including some better individual items (such as #133), then the other 39 stamps may do you well. 2021 Scott US$281.90 =	$380.55	$38.00
3223
335	Sierra Leone #1/185. Page of used beauties ranging from early QV up to the KGVI high values, with some Edward VII, KGV and Wilberforce issues in between. Most have readable "B31" or "Freetown" CDS cancels. Included (but not counted in the catalogue value) are a few with faults (such as #5). A great way to build a collection or to improve the one you have got! 2021 Scott US$435.60 =	$588.00	$60.00
2951
336	Sierra Leone #1/299, C77/C124. Selection of 24 used stamps which include £1 values from three different monarchs and some higher value airmail singles from the 1960’s. Lot includes a 1p on 6p overprinted revenue stamp, found in Barefoot but isn’t included in the catalogue value. We also noted some choice B31 cancels! 2023 Scott US$518.00 =	$699.30	$55.00
2951
337	Sierra Leone #6/207, C13/C105. Stretching the definition of "Classics" is what this African country does best. This lot starts with traditional Victorian issues, followed up with a 2d KEVII overprinted "SPECIMEN" and then moves through better KGVI & QEII issues. The only items that are never hinged and the only complete set in the lot is the Scouting Airmail set (an early "peel and stick" set, which were once scorned - little did we know). A total of 36 mint stamps on a black stockpage. 2023 Scott US$454.35 =	$613.37	$55.00
4389
338	Singapore #40/141a. Better sets and a "Festival" souvenir sheet from the first half of the reign of QEII. Includes #40-41 (hinged), followed by never hinged copies of #43-48, 62-69, 86-89 and the 1971 Festivals souvenir sheet (usual minor edge wrinkle). 2021 Scott US$322.50 =	$435.38	$32.00
6321
339	South East Asia - Box of Indo-China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos that is the remnant of two dealer’s stocks. Much is on "102" cards, saw some souvenir sheets, sheets, 1970’s maxi cards. Hundreds of mint and used stamps and lots of potential for hidden treasures. Estimate =	$150.00	$350.00
4776
340	Southwest Africa #1/539, B1-B8, C1-C6, J1/J103, O18. Mint and used duplicated selection of 525 stamps and souvenir sheets, 1923 to 1986 period issues. All laid out, organized, identified and valued on Hagner brand stock sheets. Se-tenant pairs and singles have all been accurately catalogued. A very useful lot for the philatelic fan of British Africa. Owner's 2022 Scott US$1,279.60=	$1,726.47	$170.00
6114
341	Spanish Colonies - Cuba, Puerto Rico, Spanish Guinea and Fernando Po on black stocksheets, identified and catalogued by Scott on each line/set. Mostly used classic period stamps with a number of attractive cancels noted. About 80% of the catalogue value is in the pre-Revolution Cuban material.

3742
342	Straits Settlements #10/77. Queen Victoria era selection of 44 different (mostly) used stamps (including a couple with perfins). Identified and priced by Scott on the page. A couple of obviously damaged stamps are not included in the catalogue value. 2019 Scott US$502.50 =	$678.35	$65.00
4877
343	Straits Settlements #98/246. Quintet of better values from 3 different kings, all mint and a bit heavily hinged including #98, 103, 161, 167b, 246. Fresh appearance. 2023 Scott US$398.50 =	$537.98	$85.00
4877
344	Sudan #1/159 plus BOB. Everyone’s favorite Camel riding mail carrier adorns many of the 71 used stamps on this stockpage. Minimal fault and clean cancels in this almost all different selection. Includes 11 with "AS" perfins (listed in SG, including O20a, A23). Total value of Scott listed items = US$198.00, Total SG listed items £120.00. Estimate =	$120.00	$38.00
2951
345	Swaziland #1/679, J7-J9, J14. Lightly duplicated mint and used selection of 238 stamps, 1889 to 1998 period issues. All laid out, organized, identified and valued on Hagner brand stock sheets. While you can expect the odd fault, the range of issues will prove very useful, plugging numerous holes in your collection. Owner's 2022 Scott US$618.85=	$835.45	$60.00
4389
346	Switzerland - Brown Lighthouse brand 32-page stockbook containing 1284 stamps from early "sitting Helvetia's" to the mid 1990's including "back-of-the-book" material. Looks to be almost all used, with only a scattered amount of mint throughout. The usual assortment of beautiful issues and tidy CDS postmarks that Swiss stamps are known for. A good comprehensive lot. Estimate =	$120.00	$160.00
6395
347	Switzerland - Collector's accumulation of souvenir sheets, blocks, special issues and usages. A visually appealing group which features both mint and used, as well as usages on cover / postcard. Emphasis was clearly on souvenir sheets, with a wide array of issues represented. Also noted some "joint issues", "wooden" stamp and used multiples. Included with the lot is a 2020 Zumstein specialized Switzerland catalogue (new cost approx US$30.00). A great lot to break apart, as this group would represent a fair sized initial investment to the original owner, with a good amount of "new issue postage" value alone. Estimate =	$200.00	$575.00
5841
348	Thailand #1/396. Early mint selection of Siam and Thailand stamps. Amongst the 64 stamps in total, we noticed #183, 279, 311, 317, 319, 359. A couple of the earlier are faulty or have owner’s markings but the substantive value is in cleanly hinged mint stamps. 2021 Scott US$704.60 =	$951.20	$70.00
2879
349	Thailand #11/543. Red "102 card" box, about 2/3 full with the balance of a dealer stock covering early to the 1960s. About 600 cards, most holding a single stamp with more used than mint noted. Includes #449, 471 and stamps with individual values up to $40 each with Some duplication. Well identified by Scott, with faults noted on the card if present. The dealer pricing was unrealistic, so we have estimated this lot instead. Estimate =	$160.00	$180.00
4466
350	Thailand #400/516. Better 1960’s mint issues offering of 29 stamps including #409-410 (never hinged), 416-417, 420, 449 (NH gum bends), 462-463 (never hinged), 475-476, 484, 508. A nice clean lot, the majority being lightly hinged. 2021 Scott US$590.50 =	$797.20	$42.00
2879
351	Thailand #518/2009. Several stockcards with modern Thailand, mostly in complete sets including a number with the accompanying souvenir sheets (sometimes both perforated and imperforate). Almost all should be never hinged. A very clean lot. 2021 Scott US$601.90 =	$821.57	$95.00
4466
352	Thailand #B14/54, C3/21. Better back of the book from Bangkok! An attractive group including semi-postals and airmail, some a bit heavily hinged (semi postals), while others are never-hinged (airmails). Also included is a heavily damaged but attractive imperf single of C3 with a punch hole (either a proof or printer’s waste), not counted in the total. 2021 Scott US$621.50 =	$839.05	$65.00
2879
353	Tibet - Ephemera filling medium sized box. Most of the material is non-philatelic, or barely philatelic but noted stampless folded letters (most without obvious postal markings), office stationery, forms, a nice old map (suitable for framing) and some photos (mostly 1940’s-50’s). An unusual lot, which will take some time to sort and figure. Luckily, some notes and pricing are still present in the lot (done by the previous owner who specialized in this material). Estimate =	$150.00	$150.00
3634
354	Tibet - Unduplicatable hoard of over 2000 Tibetan forgeries packed into a medium sized box. From a dealer stock, but includes some album/exhibit pages, dealer pages, a 48 page Lighthouse stockbook and a few scraps of reference and correspondence to help you make sense of this. Includes mint (in singles and sheetlets), used and a dozen covers. Sometimes the stamp is a fake, sometimes it is the cancel, sometimes it’s both! Almost all designs are from the first couple of sets, and the forgeries were produced between the 1920s-early 90s. A fascinating and valuable forgery study, from the estate of renowned Tibet stamp expert Geoffrey Flack. Estimate =	$500.00	$280.00
6025
355	Togo #66/85. Mint Hinged and used selection of 1915-1916 GeoV period issues, all overprints on Gold Coast stamps. The bulk of the catalogue value is in the mint 1915 issue #66-76. A bit of duplication noted in some lower value 1916 issues. All neatly laid out on one Hagner brand stock sheet. 2022 Scott US$246.25=	$332.44	$65.00
3961
356	Tonga #1/40. Black Hagner page with strong King George issues including perforation varieties and both overprints. A total of 15 mint and used stamps, the mint having the typical heavy hinging. 2021 Scott US$388.90 =	$538.50	$70.00
5991
357	Trinidad and Tobago #MR1a, MR11a. Used examples of the 1917-1918 one penny scarlet War Tax overprinted issues, one with inverted overprint (#MR1a), the other with the overprint doubled. Both not quite fresh but otherwise sound. 2023 Scott Classic US$550.00=	$742.50	$70.00
2951
358	USA #11/2799a. Two volume Liberty Album with pages up to about 1993. The couple of thousand stamps here are mostly mounted in top load mounts. Mostly used up to 1988, including 10c Columbus, Pan Am, Louisiana and Pan Pacific. The collection then shifts to a mix of mint and used and Includes about $265.00 US Face value including three sets of the Columbus re-issue. Finally, we noted RW57, 59-60 with a face value of $42.50 alone! Estimate =	$300.00	$150.00
2776
359	USA #36/2389 plus BOB. Battered Harris Liberty Album with pages to 1988, with owner added clear top open mounts for most stamps. Lots of $10-$100 catalogue value stamps here including 30c Columbus, 2x50c Jeffersons and up to the 10c values for the Trans-Mississippi, PanAm and Pan Pacific sets. In the modern-era there is about $90.00 US face value. Lots of airmail, express, postage dues, parcel post and parcel post dues in the "back of the book" section. Includes 40 properly used duck stamps RW10/54 (these alone catalogue about $400.00). About 2000 mostly used stamps in total. Happy hunting! Estimate =	$400.00	$550.00
3543
360	USA #331/547. A nice run of 82 stamps from the 1908-1921 Washington and Franklin definitive issues arranged on four Hagner stock sheets. Mostly used, though a few mint noted in the mix. Includes some coils, imperfs, and type differences (as noted), with several of the dollar denominations noted. A few small faults to be expected, but generally a good quality run. The owner is a self-declared "non-expert" in USA, so some of the "types" identified may need to be reassessed. No duplication. Great start to this interesting area of US philately. Owner's 2011 Scott US$454.00=	$612.90	$130.00
5479

While there are a few better items such as #186, 5c Columbian, 10c Websters, and a bit of modern postage value, the highlight is the albums themselves. In near-new condition, with the previous owner penciling in the Scott number underneath each’s stamps spot. The current Lighthouse list price for these albums is $2450!

Condition is near perfect and includes some higher value definitive issues, with the vast majority being commemorative issues. Previous owner calculated the total 2022 Scott catalogue value at US$1871.00. Conservatively valued only for the usable postage. Total face value =	$1,157.50	$875.00
4475

6255
165	Canada - Recent & modern kiloware, approx. 20 lbs in baggies crammed into a full banker's box, mostly on close-cut single paper. We noted that these are mostly definitives (as most stamped mail is), but NOT cherry-picked for uncanceled stamps. Estimate =	$150.00	$160.00
3739
166	Canada - Recent used accumulation of 363 different used stamps from 2016 - 2023 issues, includes 126 different COVID period and some higher values.

6076
167	Canada - Uhaul box with albums, stockbooks, dealer stock and "on and off" paper. The best value is likely the used Elizabethan-era, but there are bits and pieces to be found throughout including some cancel interest. Perfect for discovery, upgrading, and filling holes. Thousands upon thousands of stamps. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
6076
168	Canada and Provinces - Canada 14/88, New Brunswick 8-9, Prince Edward Island 9, Nova Scotia 2/13, Newfoundland 24/248. Always wanted a $5 Jubilee!?! You may never get another chance at a cheaper one. The 229 stamps from Canada are eye appealing, but alas, almost all faulty. We counted 24 Large Queens and high values throughout the Victorian period. The group would represent a very high catalogue value (Scott $7525.00). Definitely some cancel potential here and although faulty, many of the stamps have a great appearance. The NB/NS/PEI catalogues $482.00 with a Nova Scotia #2 (two good and one narrow margins). The 145 Newfie stamps are more weighted in the 20th century (and are generally in better shape than the rest of this offering) and catalogue $710.00. In total this lot has about 380 stamps and a total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$8717.00 = $11,767.95 CDN. As most of the valuable stamps have faults, we have decided to estimate this offering. Estimate =	$250.00	$270.00
6025
169	Canada Booklets #BK45/550. Run of 155 mostly different Elizabethan-era complete booklets. Usually only duplicated when there are different covers. Spanning from the first Karsh issue up to the NHL commemoratives with overall condition being excellent. Earlier printings are unchecked for papers, so there is still some potential to be discovered. Conservatively valued for the useable postage value alone. Total face value =	$348.51	$220.00
6150
170	Canada Booklets - A 21st century accumulation of 90 complete booklets, most from the 43c-54c era. Each identified by the previous owner (a few with residual glue from stickers). Includes both traditional "lick and stick" alongside the more modern "self-adhesive". A nice lot for the booklet collector to keep what you need, then trade / sell / use the remainder. Conservatively valued for the total useable face value alone. Total Face Value =	$406.12	$325.00
6128

An interesting and unusual lot of 349 First Day Covers, dated 2005-2015, each bearing an unusual "modern" illustrated cachet and being cancelled from around the province of BC. The postmarks in this group are quite interesting, as the collector made a point of travelling to all-ends of the province to acquire postmarks from as many different BC post offices as he could (for example, the 2005 "Hockey" series, which has all the FDC cancelled at different areas of the mid-Vancouver Island region, which means he would have travelled between those post offices on that day). A huge variety of postmarks, including many "modern" offices which were often only open for a short-period alongside dozens of "illustrated" postmarks which were often only used for special occasions. These are totally unchecked and "one of a kind" as they were made by the collector for his own collection. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6150

There is a standardized run of the "July 1st 1942" issues, all on matching small size covers addressed lightly in pencil to Los Angeles, but then there are also the "later" issues comprising of four covers from April 1943 (all with WWII patriotic cachets). The examples of #254, 259, C8, CE2 are all cancelled as "day after" FDC, as the actual FDC for these issues are seldom seen. The July 1st covers alone now catalogue $370.00 in Unitrade. An increasingly tough group to find. Estimate =	$150.00	$100.00
4688

Some better that stood out include 10 copies each of #45-46, 29 sets of #210-216, #268-72 and a badly overprinted forgery. Lots of Semi-official, airmails and postage dues to give this more breadth. Great for building a collection, filling holes, reselling or all three. Conservative guess of $3000.00 catalogue value in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$180.00
2299

A very comprehensive offering of over 2000 different stamps, mostly used up to 1966, then mint hinged up to 1980 where the mint stamps then become never hinged until 1995 before shifting again to used (and very sparse). Better stamps include #31, 64, 66, 83, 132 and semi-officials: B6-7, 11, 16, 19, 35-7, 41, 66-67. The collector has penciled in the Scott numbers underneath each stamp to aid in identification. The overall condition is good. Inexplicably, there is an additional 5th album with hingeless pages covering 2015-2018 that was never used. The retail price for the albums alone is about $3000.00 along with the substantial catalogue value in the stamps. An attractive way to house a new or existing French collection.

1837

258	German States Baden #2/27. Specialized selection of 55 duplicated 1851 to 1868 period issues, all organized on three Hagner brand stock sheets and semi-identified, with detailed notes dating from 1991 (just the priced material catalogued by the 1991 Michel at over 1,300 DM, with just as much unpriced). Expect some faults in the lot but a good number of "plus value" postmarks and shades here. Estimate =	$325.00	$48.00
6136
259	German States Oldenburg #14. VF used example of the 1861 issue 2g red imperf. Blue "SANDE" boxed postmark. 2023 Scott Classic US$450.00=	$607.50	$180.00
5621
260	Germany #4/841, B3/B375, C1/C60. Collections of Germany, Berlin and DDR. A pair of Scott Specialty 2-post albums, the first with pages up to 1960 and a matching slipcase house this very attractive 1506 stamp collection mostly in black mounts. More used than mint and the early issues have a bit of duplication because of cancel interest (noted many with socked-on-the-nose cancels) and possibly other printing differences outside of Scott listings. Lots of stamps in the $5-$25 range. The second volume is a "Germany and Colonies" binder, even though it holds Berlin and DDR stamps and is a bit sparsely populated with an additional 350 stamps. Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
6466
261	Germany #29/1355 plus BOB. Three stockbooks, nicely laid out with a dealer stock to 1981 (most is pre-1950). The first stockbook even has the lines individually numbered by Scott. While the individual stamps don’t have substantial catalogue values (up to about $5 each), there is definitely cancel potential. Over 1700 stamps plus the 32-page and 48-page Unisafe stockbooks and a 64-page Lighthouse stockbook, all in very nice condition. Estimate =	$160.00	$95.00
4552
262	Germany #671/2735 plus BOB. As new 4-volume Lighthouse hingeless albums covering post-war Germany 1949-2017 with matching slipcases. Noted a few hundred used stamps and some souvenir sheets, with a good representation up to 1996, after which it drops off and by 2006 there are very few stamps. Not a lot of valuable individual stamps here, but the value is in the albums, which have a current list price of over $1800.00! Estimate =	$600.00	$350.00
5977
263	Germany #C38-C39. F/VF mint OG Hinged 1930 issue "South America flight" 2m ultramarine and 4m black brown Graf Zeppelin airmails. Scarce material from the golden age of long-distance dirigibles. 2023 Scott US$500.00=	$675.00	$130.00
5112
264	Germany #C40-C42. Complete F/VF mint Hinged 1931 issue "Polar Flight" Graf Zeppelin airmail set of three, consisting of the 1m carmine, 2m ultramarine and 4m black brown. A "must have" set for the classic era aero-philatelist. 2023 Scott Classic $710.00=	$958.50	$170.00
6014
265	Germany - Supplies. "Local issues 1945-1946". One volume, brand new Lighthouse hingeless album (Ref. 23LOK) in blue binder with matching slipcase. No stamps. Never been used. Lighthouse list price for the unit $650.00. A nice way to house your collection at a fraction of the "new" price. Estimate =	$200.00	$95.00
6236
266	Germany - DDR #48/2803. Very complete collection of DDR running the length of its existence. A mix of mint and used, being very complete until the mid-1980’s, with most of what is missing being souvenir sheets. Better mint (hinged) issues include Mao portraits (#129 with corner crease) and Marx souvenir sheets with #226a being never hinged. Scott numbers lightly penciled under each stamp to aid in identification. About 2000 stamps, with an estimated 2023 Scott catalogue value of US$1600.00. The collection is housed in a near-new three volume Lighthouse hingeless albums with matching slipcases, which have a list price of $2150.00 alone if bought new. Estimate =	$800.00	$240.00
77
267	Germany / Zara #29 (Michel). Fresh and Fine mint NH 1943 issue WWII German Occupation "Deutsche Besetzung Zara" provisional overprint on the 5 lire deep green Italian airmail stamp. The key value to the set. Signed twice on reverse and with a smudgy red handstamp at lower left which could be a botched "Bolaffi" guarantee. 2019 Michel catalogue 11,000.00 Euros =	$16,082.00	$825.00
3780
268	Gibraltar #1266/1489. Good run of 2011-2015 issues, including a number of singles, sets and souvenir sheets, mostly different and in pristine condition. These were just recently removed from their original sales envelopes to display. Includes typical Gibraltar themes such as military, Royalty and scenery. Significant face value in each set, which contributes to a strong showing in the catalogue. 2023 Scott US$534.50 =	$721.58	$100.00
3552
269	Great Britain #3. Terrific study lot of 124 used copies mounted on black stock pages. Obvious cancel potential, with some very readable numerals. We noticed a number of 3-plus margin examples in the mix. While some faults to be expected, this is a very nice study group. 2023 Scott US$4030.00 =	$5,440.00	$110.00
3208
270	Great Britain #28. VF (four clear margins) used example of the 1856 issue 1sh green, wmk 24 (Heraldic Emblems). As per Scott footnotes, a premium has been added for superior centering. 2023 Scott Classic US$600.00=	$810.00	$140.00
163
271	Great Britain #32. Mint OG Hinged example of the 1860-1870 issue 1½p dull rose Victoria, Plate 3, watermark 2 (Large Crown). Short perf noted at lower right corner, otherwise sound and Fine. 2023 Scott Classic US$550.00=	$742.50	$55.00
163
272	Great Britain #34. Mint no gum example of the 1862 issue 4p vermilion Victoria, watermark 23 (Large Garter). A few irregular perfs at left, otherwise sound and Fine. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,250.00=	$3,037.50	$70.00
163
273	Great Britain #66. Well centered and fresh VF mint no gum example of the 1875 issue 2½p claret, plate 2, watermark 28 (Anchor). Margins well clear of design on all sides so a 50% premium has been added as per Scott footnotes. 2023 Scott classic US$1,162.50=	$1,569.38	$140.00
6136
274	Great Britain #82/1284 plus Regionals. A good starter collection in Stanley Gibbons album. The early years are a bit thin but noted a nice copy of QV #104 (cat US$210.00) and clean used copies of KEVII #136-138 (cat US$110.00), but sadly the mint Seahorses #222-223 have creases. The early QEII phosphor issues are hinged as the 1970’s issues transition into mostly mint. We counted £166.70 in face value, with face values up to £5. There is a bit of duplication and lots to build from. Estimate =	$250.00	$170.00
4406
275	Great Britain #96, 108, 109. Sound and F/VF used trio of large format 1883-1884 issue high values, consisting of the 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine. All very well centered with moderate cancels. Conservatively valued, without any of the 25% premiums added for centering (as per Scott footnotes). The 5sh and 10sh values both have "HSB" perfins. 2023 Scott US$1,090.00=	$1,471.50	$95.00
5112
276	Great Britain #98-107. Generally Fine used complete set of ten 1883-1884 period issues, from the ½p up to the 1sh high value. Expect the odd small fault. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,994.00=	$2,691.90	$120.00
3266
277	Great Britain #124. Sound and fresh VF used, oval registered cancelled example of the 1891 issue £1.00 green Queen Victoria, watermark 30 (Imperial Crowns). As per Scott footnotes, a 25% premium for centering (margins clear of design) has been added. A superior quality Victorian era high value. 2023 Scott US$1,156.25=	$1,560.94	$210.00
6052
278	Great Britain #142. Sound and Very Fine centered used example of the 1902 issue £1 blue green Edward VII high value. Clear London oval Registered cancels (SE '29 '15). A fault free and superior quality Edwardian era top value. 2023 Scott Classic US$825.00=	$1,113.75	$220.00
1837
279	Great Britain #U1. Mulready Postal Stationery Envelope. A strikingly clean and attractive June 3rd 1840 usage with red "Maltese Cross" posted from London to The Earl of Arran in Wexford. Much better condition than often seen, with a nice historically important connection with the addressee. 2023 Scott Specialized US$600.00 =	$810.00	$150.00
5742
280	Great Britain #U1/U4. Duo of unused Mulready stationery. Includes the 1p black envelope with a bit of mounting damage at the top (back) and a bit grubby but of particular interest is the inside, where a previous owner detailed how he was given the piece in 1865!. The 2p blue is in lettersheet format with a bit of minor staining on the back and a crease. Not unusual condition for either of these early Victorian postal stationery pieces. Total 2023 Scott US$800.00 =	$1,080.00	$170.00
6157
281	Great Britain - Accumulation of material from a wide range of sources. A result of multiple holdings that didn't lead direct path as a single lot, so were set-aside. Eventually, a number of these collections, accumulations, covers, stamps etc. add up to fill a box...and that is what we have done here. Noted some higher value modern commercial covers and FDCs, a few presentation packs, stamps on and off paper, as well as some fragments from albums (goes back to Victorian times). There is lots to discover here! Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
6466
282	Great Britain - File box of covers. Includes a couple hundred first day and commemorative (RAF, flight) covers from 1960’s-80’s. Some in albums, some free-range and includes a bit of commercial mail (including some jumbo "insured/registered") and the odd active service cover. The highlight has to be the 28-page booklet with over 20 covers produced for the 1960 National Maritime Museum Exhibition. Only 90 of these booklets were produced and includes the original correspondence from 1963. Estimate =	$150.00	$90.00
6150
283	Great Britain - Group of 80 album pages of mid-QEII era print varieties. Expertly assembled and covering 1976-1987, most of these pages have SG listed varieties, including print shifts, flyspecs, plate flaws, paper and gum variants etc. Seem to be all VF mint Never hinged, mounted with the regular stamp and often a cylinder block. A few FDCs round out the collection. Perfect to make your collection of modern GB have a bit of "zing" to it. The original cost and effort to accumulate this material was significant. Around 500 stamps in total. A great lot for any collector of Elizabethan Great Britain. Estimate =	$300.00	$260.00
5660
284	Great Britain - Massive mixed Condition 19th to mid-20th Century Accumulation. Mostly used selection/accumulation of hundreds of 1840s to 1940s period issues, covering Victoria, Edward VII, George V and George VI era material. All neatly laid out on Hagner brand stock sheets. Note that the condition is VERY mixed with faults noted throughout (take this into account when determining a bid) but there could be some cancel or variety interest in this uninspected group. Take a good look at the scans to judge for yourself. Owner's 2023 Scott US$11,195.00=	$15,113.25	$250.00
6466
285	Great Britain - Modern Mint Medley. A choice selection of sets, singles and souvenir sheets from the 1999-2012 period, still neatly arranged on the stockcards as received from the Royal Mail (most with receipts as well). A nice array of topics here including Millenium, Extreme Endeavors, British Museum, 2012 London Paralympics, Christmas, Bridges and Comics. Noted many "Pound Plus" stamps, 167x 1st Class, "E" Europe rates and the 2010 issued Special Delivery self-adhesive stamps. Conservatively valued at the postage face value. Total usable GB face value is 361.77 pounds, converted at today’s rate into CDN$=	$617.58	$675.00
6108
286	Great Britain - Modern souvenir sheets, mostly from the last 25 years plus 12x 1st class 100g labels. All in good condition with 45 in total (noted the "Penny Black and 2p Blue" 175th anniversary sheets) and includes 10 from the Channel Islands. Lots of "stamp on stamp" themes as well as the major Royal and WWII anniversary isses. Well protected in a high-end 32 page blue "Comfort" stockbook with acetate strips. Conservatively valued at the total face value of the stamps alone. Total face value £190.84 =	$318.70	$260.00
6108
287	Great Britain - Recent £ values used. Selection of 89 different recent & modern £1 & up values. Many of these are very difficult to find used since so few people use stamps anymore. 2024 Scott US$311.00 =	$419.85	$120.00
4406
288	Great Britain - Research grouping of forty stampless folded letters from the first half of the 19th century. Noted some free franking, OHMS and cancel potential. Most of the items have been neatly laid out in single page clear plastic pages, giving both protection and ease of access to read. Typical mixed condition for the era, but a seldom seen larger offering from an estate, having not seeing the light of day in decades. Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
5977
289	Great Britain - Selection of recent used consisting of 92 different 2017 - 2023 issues (no Machins). Of particular note, 56 of these are £1 & up face values! Recent used commemoratives are very difficult to find since so few people use stamps anymore. 2024 Scott US$ 221.50 =	$299.03	$170.00
6128
290	Great Britain - U-Haul box with a range of albums, stockbooks, dealer cards and loose pages. Strength is in pre-decimal QEII, but noted a bit of worthwhile earlier and over £50 in decimal era face value from the 70’s-80s. Noted an older Lighthouse hingeless album with pages covering 1953-68, a 1985 year set, three stockbooks with mostly used QEII era stamps, a couple of Collecta and an old SG album with early QEII pages and stamps. A few early Elizabethan booklets and a bit of QV-KEVII singles on card that have some potential. A real mix here, in need of a good sort. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3208
291	Great Britain - Alderney #1/538. A pair of Stanley Gibbons albums with added clear top opening mounts is the perfect host for this near complete collection. The pages run 1983-2018, but there are no stamps after 2015 except a couple of booklets. All the stamps are in perfect condition. The collector penciled in the Scott catalogue numbers beside the SG numbers. An affordable way to add to your Channel Islands collection. Albums, pages and matching slip cases retail $250.00. Conservatively valued for the total face value of the mint stamps. Total face value £284.00 =	$474.30	$180.00
269
292	Great Britain - Guernsey #2/1319 plus BOB. Large five-volume Stanley Gibbons album set with pages from 1941-2018 and matching slip cases house (retail value $500.00). This unbelievable opportunity to get a relatively affordable, near complete collection of Guernsey to within the last decade. The owner expertly added clear, top opening mounts and penciled in Scott numbers next to the Stanley Gibbons catalogue number. The collection itself is in excellent condition and is a bit of a mix of mint and used up to 2000, but along the way it contains a significant amount of newer issues that have a face value alone of £731.00 ($1206.00 CDN). Estimated at considerably less than the mint face value postage alone, with an excellent set of albums included. Estimate =	$950.00	$325.00
269
293	Great Britain - Isle of Man #1/411, J1/J24. Collection housed within a Stanley Gibbons 22-ring binder with pages to 1989. A very complete offering of 400 stamps, 18 booklets and 8 souvenir sheets. Stamps all appear to be mint, never hinged and arranged in mounts. The bit of duplication is either for display purposes, or because of overlapping purchases by the collector. A very clean and relatively complete offering from this time period. 2023 Scott US$347.95 =	$469.73	$60.00
4453
294	Great Britain - Jersey #1/1895 plus some BOB. Massive collection of Jersey, Channel Islands from 1941 to 2016, housed in a 5-volume Stanley Gibbons album set with matching slip covers (these alone retail about $700.00). The collector added clear open top mounts and proceeded to fill them with a range of both mint (hinged) and used stamps (early years), followed by a relentless pursuit of new issues after 1985 with face values up to £10. Missing the occasional stamp, souvenir sheet or booklet, this is an extensive collection to build from. Very conservatively valued by the face value alone in this collection, although consideration should be given to the matched set of albums as well. Total face value £1199.00 =	$2,002.00	$425.00
77
295	Great Britain Channel Islands - Guernsey (1/400, J1-J41, N1-3), Alderney (1-41), Jersey (1/531, J1-46, N1-8). Duo of Stanley Gibbons albums (one binder with back cover split), contain one of the nicest, most complete collections of this type that you are likely to find. Starts with the WWII occupation issues and goes to 1989, with very few missing stamps. Regional issues onwards, all are mint never hinged, including the better sub numbers, booklet panes, back of the book and souvenir sheets. All arranged in black open-top mounts. Guernsey has 422 stamps & 12 booklets & 6 panes with a total catalogue value US$363.55, Alderney has 41 stamps cataloguing US$42.00 and Jersey has 550 stamps, 18 booklets and 40 panes with a total catalogue value US$347.50. Only minor duplication, usually for the purposes of eye appeal. Total 2023 Scott US$753.05 =	$1,016.60	$170.00
4453
296	Greenland #1/229, B1/B40a. Nearly complete mint regular issues covering 1938-1990 and semi-postals up to 2015. The obvious missing set is the WWII liberation overprint set. While the earlier issues are hinged, the collection then shifts to consistently never hinged after 1980. Neatly arranged on Scott Specialty pages in hingleless mounts, with a matching narrow binder and slipcase. A very clean, attractive offering. 2023 Scott US$1040.65 =	$1,404.88	$825.00
2060
297	Greenland #1/328, B3/B22. Fresh, sound and F/VF mint H/NH selection of 136 stamps, 1938 to 1998 period issues. Loaded with complete sets depicting all sorts of Greenland and Arctic subjects. 2022 Scott US$543.50=	$733.33	$80.00
1315
298	Greenland #19-27. Complete set of overprints honoring the liberation of Denmark at the end of the Second World War. Each stamp is overprinted and neatly cancelled in the lower corner. Overall condition is excellent A key Greenland set. 2023 Scott US$885.00 =	$1,194.75	$300.00
3795
299	Greenland #22a. The key 10 ore value with carmine coloured overprint, beautiful rich colour, mint and extremely lightly hinged. Overprinted to celebrate the liberation of Denmark at the end of World War II. The usual overprint was in black ink, but a small number of panes were given a red overprint. 2023 Scott US$375.00 =	$506.25	$130.00
2060
300	Greenland #231/556. Nearly complete used collection of Greenland, covering 1990-2009, mostly philatelic usages (as most have clean first day cancels). The result is cleanly used stamps with readable cancels. Housed in a Scott Specialty album with matching slipcase, this lot has ENORMOUS catalogue value and initial cost. Total 2023 Scott US$1515.90 =	$2,046.46	$325.00
2060
301	Greenland #390/570. Lot of 84 different First Day Covers from 2001-2008 including the Parcel Post Centenary, #497, 497a. Pleasingly displayed on Vario-brand pages and housed in a Scott Specialty three ring binder with matching slipcase, all in excellent condition. Greenland produced relatively lower numbers of issues, in relatively lower quantities with Scandinavian face values. As a result, these covers have significant catalogue value (usually $15-$25 each). Conservatively valued for the catalogue price of the stamps only, with no extra consideration for the FDC. 2023 Scott of US$830.65 =	$1,121.38	$110.00
2060
302	Greenland #559/743. A very complete collection of used Greenland issues covering 2010-2016, with a little bit of more recent material added that the collector didn’t get around to mounting. Primarily philatelic usages from first day covers, missing the occasional souvenir sheet or different perf variety/booklet die cutting, for which there were no philatelic sales. Still a very pleasing offering, with stamps in excellent condition and tidy cancels. Protected in a Scott Specialty binder (non-Greenland, no slipcase). Total 2023 Scott US$1569.15 =	$2,118.35	$210.00
2060
303	Greenland #568/712. Lot of 83 mostly different First Day Covers from 2009-2015 including the Art and Mining issues. Pleasingly displayed on Vario-brand pages and housed in a Scott Specialty three ring binder with matching slipcase. The covers and album are both in excellent condition. Greenland produced relatively lower numbers of issues, in relatively lower quantities, with Scandinavian face values. As a result, these covers have significant catalogue values of up to $30 a cover (for the stamps only). Conservatively catalogued for the stamps only. 2023 Scott US$960.10 =	$1,296.13	$150.00
2060
304	Grenadines of Grenada #1/1645. Mint NH and CTO duplicated selection of 1973-1994 period issues, including 305 stamps, souvenir sheets and intact booklets. Excellent range of subject matter. A perfect lot for the topical collector or dealer. 2022 Scott US$442.90 =	$597.92	$55.00
5999
305	Haiti #1/867 plus BOB. Better than average Haitian collection of about 900 mint (hinged) and used stamps. Includes some good Liberty Head coverage and notable issues such as #30, B1, CB1-2, C19a imperf, C318A. Lots of overprints, airmails and souvenir sheets. Great appeal to topical collectors. Neatly mounted on Scott Specialized album with pages to 1973, then another type of Scott pages to 1986. Good hunting here. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
4827
306	Heligoland #1/25. The "Good, the Bad and the Ugly" duplicated lot of 167 mint and used stamps, including original genuine issues, reprints and forgeries, in sound and sometimes faulty condition. Offered intact as originally received from a very old estate, completely unchecked by us. All neatly laid out on three stock sheets to facilitate inspection. Take a VERY good look at the scans as there are very possibly gems mixed in with the more pedestrian material. As interesting an unpicked lot of these 1860s-1880s period former North Sea British possession (ceded to Schleiswig-Holstein in 1890) as we have ever offered. Estimate =	$350.00	$120.00
6025
307	Hong Kong #10/792. British rule era accumulation of 800 stamps and many souvenir sheets housed in a 16-page Lighthouse brand stockbook. The early material is mostly used and has some treaty port cancels ("S1", "Y1", "Shanghai"), with a good range through the Kings and then mid-QEII period including some Common Design issues. There is some mint material from the 1990’s including blocks of the "Colour of Chinese" characters issues and a number of souvenir sheets with quantities up to 15 of a kind. Noted individual stamps with catalogue values up to $20.00 each. Likely a few hidden gems to be found by the studious collector. Estimate =	$160.00	$260.00
3732
308	Hong Kong #12/179. Stocksheet with QV-KGVI used issues. Included amongst the 77 stamps are some nicer individual values including most of the Centenary and the Royal Wedding set. Many of the more common values have clear, readable cancels. The bottom row (not included in the catalogue total) includes 5 stamps with perfins, 1 with a rubberstamp and the final with a possible revenue cancel. 2021 Scott US$279.70 =	$377.87	$120.00
4389
309	Hong Kong Revenue - Barefoot Stamp Duty #27a. Sound and VF used example of the 1892 issue TEN DOLLARS grey-green Stamp Duty high value, watermark Crown CC. Cancelled both by pen and with the premium "HONG KONG PAID ALL" CDS. 2012 Barefoot catalogue £350.00=	$596.00	$75.00
6025
310	Indian Convention States - Chamba, Gwalior, Jind, Nabha and Patalia. Collection of key Kings! Includes Chamba #82, O66, O68, Gwalior #112, 114-5, O48-50, Jind #147, O73, Nabha #49, 83, O49 and Patalia #95, O50, O60-62. Lovely, fresh, well centered copies. Most are KGVI, but a couple of KGV decided to join in. Includes regular and "Service" issues with most being never hinged (if not NH, then lightly hinged or have the slightest of gum disturbance). An outstanding group! 2021 Scott US$548.75 =	$740.80	$200.00
4858
311	Indonesia #1/1945 plus BOB. A dealer’s stock covering 1948-2001 housed in a four pocket KABE 32-page stockbook. Noted both mint and used, with duplication of up-to 10 of a stamp. The previous owner did a detailed inventory in 2012, counting about 1210 stamps. We compared against the current Scott and are comfortable with the total being reasonable close to what today’s total would be. Owner’s 2012 Scott US$1710.00 =	$2,308.50	$60.00
2951
312	Indonesia - Uncommon grouping of 440 covers, most 1950s-60s, but a few earlier to the Dutch-Indies era. Includes lots of first day covers (with duplication), commercial mail (with a bundle used to ADEN!), a touch of postal stationery/air letters and even some tourist postcards. Expect some faults, but overall condition is excellent. Lots of registered items, including to Canada and Great Britain. A good chance to get in on some underappreciated postal history.

314	Israel - Box of covers with commemorative and Pictorial cancels issued between 1968-1988. This holding has between 1000-1100 covers, each a small size, unaddressed, with the Israeli post office cachet and a contemporary low value definitive tied by a different commemorative cancel. This holding came directly from the Israeli pictorial cancel service, most still wrapped in the original paperwork. This appears to have been an annual subscription, and the collector never got around to dealing with them, so they are pretty much "as received" mercifully the rubber bands are not original. Estimate =	$200.00	$60.00
6434
315	Italy and San Marino - Mainly mint San Marino dealer’s stock with up to 10 of a type, #3/1628 and some good BOB, catalogued in 2013 at US$822.00.

5112
329	Montserrat #1/614 plus a bit of BOB. A good run of Montserrat from the Victorian period up to 1986. As always, the earlier mint issues tend to be hinged. Noted the Royal Wedding, 1951 and 1953 definitive issues, a couple of First Day covers, booklets and some Specimen overprints (modify your expectations - they are more recent). The added value in this lot comes in the form of barely-touched computer-generated album pages that goes up to 2002. 2021 Scott US$439.60 =	$593.46	$65.00
6035
330	Natal #2. Mint 1857 issue embossed 6 Pence imperf on green paper. Small flaws including a couple of pinholes (common with these rough-hewn provisionals). A very rare early issue from British Africa in any condition. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,000.00=	$2,700.00	$190.00
6136
331	Netherlands #2/1211 plus a bit of Colonies. Very thorough collection of 2400 regular issue commemoratives & definitives from the first issue until the end of 2005.

5658
332	Netherlands #B1/B748. A complement to the previous lot. Near complete semi-postals on tidy homemade pages, with most mint stamps in black mounts. Early issues start off with a mix of mint (hinged) or used issues. After 1975 the issues are primarily mint and never hinged, usually with the matching souvenir sheet or booklet.

Great eye-catching thematics, consisting of one single imperf, otherwise all pairs or blocks. Huge catalogue value upside if you revalue these by the specialized French catalogues. Worth full Scott! Owner's 2017 Scott as regular stamps US$153.45 =	$207.23	$42.00
4389
334	Nigeria #4/113. A magnificent selection of two-dozen stamps, representing of some of the nicest used Nigeria that you will ever see.

4389
340	Paraguay #23/1796 plus BOB. Far more thorough than often seen offering from this South American paradise. Includes over 1500 different mint (hinged) and used stamps mounted on Minkus pages protected by a battered Global Supreme binder. The pages go to 1994, but there are few stamps past 1978. Good coverage from 1887-1960’s with both perforated and imperforate issues and a nice showing of souvenir sheets (including sports, space, animal topics). The back of the book is well represented with lots of airmail and officials. The minor duplication is usually because there is both a mint and used example. Estimate =	$250.00	$250.00
4827
341	Poland and Baltics #11/1412 plus BOB. Old Schaubek album with pages up to 1964 and stamps not much past that (which shows us that this collection has not been touched in decades). The album has pages for Poland, General Government, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Poland has an even representation throughout, noted some Grozny overprints and local issues, a few 1950’s used souvenir sheets and good selection from the back of the book. The other countries have similar coverage, with a broad offering but no show-stoppers. Throughout there are excellent examples of a range of cancels. About 1000 mint (hinged) and used stamps in total. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
5841
342	Portugal and Colonies - Disorganized collection of over 1000 stamps distributed on 50 album or stock pages. Some meticulously identified and catalogued, others...not so much.

163
344	Romania #22/2725 plus BOB. An amalgamation of two collections, one on quadrilled pages and the other on Minkus pages. Once you ignore the top half of the first page (which we believe are reprints or forgeries), this collection develops into a pleasantly complete collection including many of the King Charles’ issues, and some very nice semi-postal issues. There are also pages of duplicates with shades and cancel potential. About 3300 stamps here, which should prove rewarding for the patient collector. Estimate =	$200.00	$70.00
3732
345	Saint Helena #3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21.

The 1923 issue ''Collection de Timbres de Transvaal'' booklet containing 63 different "mint" reprints of 1885 to 1901 period issues including Occupation overprints and values to £5.00. An exceptional reference source for the Commonwealth collector and South African philatelic researcher. Note that many of the Transvaal stamps that are found in collections are actually these reprints (particularly the higher values). Estimate =	$325.00	$55.00
4858
348	Sweden #LX1p. Fine mint no gum Scott Classic and Facit listed reprint (1st printing) of the 1856 issue 1sk black stamp for City Postage. A scarce Swedish forerunner. 2023 Scott Classic US$525.00=	$708.75	$34.00

2879

4533

Neatly mounted in black top opening mounts on quadrilled pages. The lot includes the good 1990’s sets that are always desired by topical collectors. A handful of stamps away from having a complete first half-century of issued stamps. 2022 Scott US$1002.65 =	$1,353.88	$210.00

3552
358	Turks and Caicos Islands #555/1109. The second of a three part, very complete Elizabethan-era collection. This volume includes all commemoratives issued between 1983-1994. All stamps appear to be mint, never hinged, with no obvious faults noted. Lots of topical interest which has pushed up the catalogue value of these attractive issues in recent years. Mounted in black top opening mounts on computer generated quadrilled pages, housed in a blue springback album. 2022 Scott US$1562.85 =	$2,109.84	$260.00

There is a random assortment of 38 lightly duplicated World Heritage prestige booklets circa 2000-2005 (these catalogue $15-20 each). The collection then goes back to the earlier days of the UN, with some interesting FDC, meters, permit and even a US International Reply Coupon cancelled at the UN New York office. Saw some UNESCO-themed FDCs from non-UN entities. There is a handful of new issue stamps and souvenir sheets from the late 60’s-mid’70s that don’t appear to have been touched since they were bought and there are a few sheets of the 1 ½ c first UN headquarters issue. Estimate =	$200.00	$250.00
5531
361	United Nations - Dual and Triple UN office cancelled first day covers 1971-2015 with each bearing either 2 or 3 stamp-issuing UN offices (depending on which were open at the time of release). The first 199 covers are smaller sized, as the stamp issues were smaller and there was only New York and Geneva and are mounted in 2 pocket Vario-brand pages. When the stamp, set or souvenir sheets got larger (or if a third issuer was added) the covers can only fit in 1 pocket Vario pages. There are 128 of these larger format covers. Significant catalogue value in the more recent issues and representing a very expensive original retail cost. A total of 327 covers and over 100 Vario pages all neatly arranged within 5 blue padded FDC albums with matching slip cases. A wonderful lot of "supplies alone". Estimate =	$300.00	$160.00

The material is housed in two printed White Ace albums and in a slightly reduced stock book (some pages have been cut out). Seems to be pretty comprehensive but didn't go through it with a fine-toothed comb. This being said, the material is of very high quality. Also, they did a very accurate count and catalogue valuation for all three volumes. Owner's accurate 2022 Scott US$961.85=	$1,298.50	$230.00
5531
363	USA #27/2163a, C1-6, Q1-12, JQ1/5 and postal stationery. Two volume "All American" padded Minkus albums with pages up to 1985. The pages and the binders themselves are in excellent shape!

In the mid 1970’s, more mint material is introduced, with face values up to $9.35 (total face value = $183.01 USD). We noted #310, and booklet pane 1623Ba. The second volume starts with a dozen pages of air mail booklet panes, and then is entirely filled with 100 mint postal stationery postal cards, envelopes and air letters from the 1970’s to early 80’s.

Most are mint, with most earlier cards having no printing on back, but the occasional corner fault to be expected. Noted UX1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 21, UY1, 2, 6 and an example of UxC8 which is postally used to New Zealand. Total UPSS postal card catalogue value $555.00.

There are a couple of US envelopes overprinted for use in Cuba and a couple of Philippine Islands mint stationery envelopes. Total catalogue value Scott US$720.00 =	$972.00	$95.00
3408
369	USA Covers - First Flight FFC Collection Part 1. Bankers box containing 9 binders, with a total of 204 covers mostly arranged by Airline or Carrier. Included Continental, Frontier, National, Ozark and TWA. The majority of these seem to be the often-obscure 1970's period flights offered by these Airlines. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
4431
370	USA Covers - First Flight FFC Collection Part 2. Bankers box containing 10 binders, with a total of 197 covers from the classic 1930's flights to the obscure flights of the 1960's. Noted several Airport Dedication covers and many "signed" covers needing further research. An attractive group offered as received, not having seen the light of day in a couple decades! Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
5495
371	USA Covers - Small box packed with collector made First Day Covers from the 1996-1999 period, each with a seldom seen "modern" illustrated cachet. Along with being a group of unusual cachet FDC, the collector also made a point of visiting some obscure Post Offices within Washington State (primarily) to get these First Day Covers cancelled. A wealth of modern cancels, alongside a fair-size investment in stamps alone! A total of 374 covers here, great for the "modern" US collector. Estimate =	$120.00	$44.00
5531
372	Wallis and Futuna #1/498. C2/C195. In a philatelic tribute to the isolation of this French colony North of Fiji in the Pacific, the collector hid this grouping of 285 mostly mint stamps in the middle of a 64-page Lighthouse stockbook with acetate strips! A total of 285 stamps, up to 1997 (the early ones are hinged, as usual). Includes good representation of the "France Libre" overprints, as well as French Colonial common design, and popular topics such as birds and aircraft. Very clean and attractive grouping. 2023 Scott US$642.75 =	$867.70	$170.00
4776
373	Worldwide - A Mickey Mouse lot. But it includes Goofy, Pluto, Daffy and Daisy as well as the more modern Pixar fare such as Toy Story. This 2-album lot includes an original 1980 Specialty album with similar 9 stamp, 1 souvenir sheet and 3 First Day Covers from Dominica, Grenada + Grenadines, Turks and Caicos, Maldives, Antigua, St. Lucia, etc. The second is a 16-page black stockbook with 32 more recent souvenir sheets. All stamps appear to be VF mint never higned. A grand total 15 sets, 40 souvenir sheets and 24 FDCs. Almost guaranteed that you will be paying less than the original owner, as the original cost likely approached $500.00. Estimate=	$140.00	$85.00
3613
374	Worldwide - Attractive 1977 QEII Silver Jubilee collection on White Ace pages (with black mounts). Mostly British Commonwealth countries, but also includes issues from other countries around the globe, that a cynic would say were trying to "jump on the bandwagon". Sets, souvenir sheets, gutter pairs and booklets which all appear to be very fine, mint and never hinged. A substantial offering with significant initial cost. A total of 390 stamps, 96 souvenir sheets and 11 booklets. Estimate =	$150.00	$36.00
269
375	Worldwide - Box containing 15 old stamp albums and springbacks, all at least 40 years old with a wide range of stamps. Thousands of stamps, ranging from topicals to some classic material. We haven’t taken the time to go through this in detail, so who knows what could be found by the intrepid collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$190.00
6486
376	Worldwide - Box containing thousands of stamps, in almost every conceivable presentation including album pages, stock cards and loose (both on and off paper). From earlier periods to modern, dozens of different countries represented. A good sort is needed on this group, which should prove rewarding. Estimate =	$130.00	$75.00
6486
377	Worldwide - Collections of 1978 Captain Cook Bicentenary, 1981 Wedding of Prince Charles (sic) and 1983 Commonwealth Day issues on specialty White Ace album pages (with black mounts). Appears to be near (if not) complete with the stamps being in perfect condition. The Cook section consists of 201 stamps and 49 souvenir sheets, not surprisingly heavily tied to the countries that he travelled. Despite the "Prince Charles" title, it is actually Princess Diana that is featured in the second section with 162 stamps, 82 souvenir sheets and 5 booklets. The final chapter is the underappreciated holiday of Commonwealth Day, which was commemorated in 1983 with 216 stamps and 6 souvenir sheets. Be grateful that it wasn’t you who bought these as new issues as the initial cost would be immense. A total 578 stamps, 137 souvenir sheets and 5 booklets. Estimate =	$200.00	$70.00
3613
378	Worldwide - File box with 9 stockbooks with a range of sizes, styles, manufacturers, condition and "fullness" plus a two volume modern used Canada collection 2002-2013 on "Parliament" printed pages (includes lots of commemoratives). A wide-variety in the stamps which run from classics to "Dunes". Many countries represented in the few thousand stamps, plus there is some value in the albums themselves. Good hunting here. Estimate =	$150.00	$150.00
6478
379	Worldwide - HOARD of 19 old albums which fill THREE Uhaul boxes. Includes Harris (multiple volumes of Standard, Statesman, Traveller), as well as Regent & Comprehensive albums. A range of "completeness" with some sparsely filled, while others are packed. Along with these albums is a binder with over 40 Vario-brand pages filled with stamps. There has to be 30,000 stamps here, with not too many after 1980, but far too many for us to take a close look at. Hours of fun are guaranteed here. Estimate =	$350.00	$350.00
6478
380	Worldwide - Penny Black Sesquicentennial (150th anniversary). A lovely 100 page Fleetwood created collection in custom 3-post binder (minor scuff on the cover). Includes a detailed account of the development of the world’s first postage stamp, showing illustrations of the major players and the processes that lead up to the 1840 date of issue. The 129 stamps and 32 souvenir sheets, from a wide variety of countries are attractively mounted in black mounts. This would make for a nice addition to a Penny Black or early British collection. It makes for interesting reading and would also will be of interest to a "stamp on stamp" topical collector. Enormous initial cost. Estimate =	$140.00	$190.00
5055
381	Worldwide - Picker’s delight! Uhaul box with balance of a consignment. Includes 5 albums, 3 stockbooks and a mess of loose albums and stockpages, with dealer cards all piled in. Noted Hungary, Sweden, Mexico, Asia, British Commonwealth and Cinderellas. What wasn’t easy to sort went into this box, so expect a bit of everything. Estimate =	$150.00	$250.00
5719
382	Worldwide - Seven volumes of world-wide collections in Minkus and Harris albums, filling two file boxes. The printed pages go up to the mid-1960’s, with the stamps surpassing that (up to about 2008). Thousands of stamps, running from school-age type material to better issues scattered throughout. Wide coverage, probably over 20,000 stamps. The albums have been loved to death and some are held together by duct tape. The stamps will give you and your stamp collector friends hours of fun. Estimate =	$500.00	$325.00
5999
383	Worldwide - Stamp / Coin / Banknote combination collection. A deluxe 3-volume collection aptly named "The World's First Coin, Stamp & Banknote Collection". Produced in the 1990's by the "Excelsior" company, these albums are filled with custom pages, each to present a banknote along with a "coin insert" cachet cover (often fully illustrated). A true "trip around the globe" within these albums, with a total of 73 different coin / stamp covers and 73 different banknotes being showcases. Although we are not sure of the exact original cost of these, it is sufficient to say that it was substantial. Estimate =	$250.00	$160.00
4388
384	Worldwide - Two albums of train topicals, starting with a large offering of "A" to "I" countries with the stamps in clear mounts packed into a thick red springback album, including classic issues such as Belgium alongside more modern fare (such as Bhutan). The second album is a 16-page Unisafe stockbook with a wide range of sets and souvenir sheets from a wide range of countries. Significant effort and expense went into accumulating this selection. We counted 1570 mint (mostly never hinged) and used stamps, 91 souvenir sheets and 5 booklets. Estimate =	$200.00	$150.00
4343
385	Worldwide - Two binders with a significant accumulation packed into 60 Hagner or Vario brand black stocksheets. Better material is from the People’s Republic of China, Germany and Jugoslavia. The previous owner meticulously counted and catalogued the over 7000 stamps. Total 2022 Scott US$2165.00 =	$2,922.75	$130.00
6274
386	Worldwide - Well populated "International" album circa 1925 with over 3000 stamps up to about 1935. Has broad coverage, but noted good showings of British America (Canada saw a mint 15c Large Queen plus some Provinces and lots from Caribbean colonies), Europe, Latin America, China, India and Japan. No US, other than a few revenues. Noted random stamps with individual catalogue values up to $25 a stamp. A great lot to sort. Happy hunting! Estimate	$200.00	$190.00
6274
387	Worldwide and Supplies - British Africa stock of mostly used, lower value singles from Queen Victoria up to about 1960 housed in 2 red "102 card" boxes filled with about 1200 lightly used and 100 new "102" cards. Value is primarily in the supplies and the cost of the these boxes and cards likely outshines the stamps within. Estimate =	$120.00	$150.00
4533
388	Worldwide Covers - Collection of the 1953-1954 Royal Tour, wonderfully illustrated by postal history. A small black binder containing 34 stamps and 37 covers, all issued to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth & The Duke of Edinburgh as they circumnavigated the globe in 6 months, making many first…or "first since Coronation" visits to a wide array of Commonwealth countries. Also included with the lot is a very nice edition of the book "Royal Tour" by Wynford Vaughan Thomas, which takes an in-depth look at the details and events of the trip as recorded at the time. Estimate =	$140.00	$38.00
3208
389	Worldwide Covers - WWI Censorship in Great Britain. A well-researched mounted and notated exhibit collection of 39 covers, all featuring the WWI censor tapes of Great Britain. A nice variety of material (above and beyond the "usual" as often needed in an exhibit) including incoming covers from Netherlands, Switzerland, USA, Canada and Sweden alongside a couple of POW (Prisoner of War) Camp covers. The research alone on this lot would take considerable time, especially when it comes to the identification of censor types. A wonderful group to enrich your knowledge on WWI British Censorship. Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
3208
390	Worldwide Postcards - Banker's box HOARD of worldwide postcards. An absolute sorter's dream, with a total of 3095 postcards from around the world. We only gave this one a cursory look before having the cards counted, so offered as received with potential finds to be had. A mix of "older" to "newer", with the majority being the latter. We even noted a sealed pack of modern Canada Post "prepaid" postcards near the top ($2.71 postage value each). The patient lady who counted these noted that the postcard "packs" were not counted in the grand total. Estimated at less than 6c per card! Estimate =	$150.00	$95.00
6150
391	Worldwide Postcards - Collection of "Zieher" Stamp Illustrated Postcards. An eye-catching and appealing group of 20 postcards, each illustrated with postage stamps from countries which include as New Zealand, British Guiana, Tasmania, Mexico, South Australia, Gibraltar, Great Britain, Cape of Good Hope, San Marino, Russia, Uruguay, Hungary and Tunisia. These postcards became very popular in the 1900-1910 period, with a postcard publisher named Ottmar Zieher of Munich, Germany being one of the most prominent producers. Sixteen of these cards are directly attributed to Zieher, with the remaining four cards likely his (or a competitor at the time). Seldom offered in groups, a nice assembly. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00
5979
392	Worldwide Postcards - Group of 6 Postcard Albums, filled with a total of 536 postcards from around the world. A real mix of material in here, which did not seem to have any rhyme or reason behind the arrangement within the albums. A mix of both topographical and topical cards included several nice Christmas greetings depicting Santa Claus. Although the majority seem to be more modern cards, there are "sleepers" and older cards mixed throughout to please the deltiologist. Estimate =	$140.00	$32.00
5907
393	Worldwide Supplies - Group of 7 Lighthouse brand deluxe 3-ring albums (all with dust jackets). A premium group of albums, with at least half of them appearing to have never been used. These albums are now over $50 each retail, with the price seeming on the rise each year due to supply chain issues. While five of these are your standard size, two are oversized and can fit a variety of oversized pages (still with the standard 3-hole arrangement). A nice chance to pick up a premiums group of binders, while not having to pay retail. Estimate =	$160.00	$190.00
6442
394	Worldwide Topicals - Collection of the 2009 International Geophysics, Global Warming and Astrophysics years. Tied to an interest in United Nations material, this collector assembled collections from countries which issued stamps for a common cause.

Mounted on 1-5 pocket Vario-brand pages and in a blue padded Lighthouse three-ring binder with matching slipcase. Significant effort and cost went into assembling this. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
5658
395	Worldwide Topicals - Flowers / Horticulture of the World. A somewhat messy, but surprisingly in-depth collection of mint and used from countries "A to L" arranged alphabetically on pages within an (aptly) green 2-inch binder. Lots of better material noted throughout, likely collected one set or single at a time over a period of years. A total of 3958 stamps, 28 souvenir sheets and 4 covers. Take a good look at the scans to appreciate the scope of the collection. Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
6321
396	Worldwide Topicals - International Refugee Year (1959/60) and Malaria Eradication Year (1962) in two volumes. A selection of singles, sets, souvenir sheets, with perforated/imperf variants, deluxe proofs, multiples, and a few First Day Covers (or covers with commemorative cancels).

An assembly that took some effort and expense to develop. Mounted on Vario-brand 1-5 pocket pages in a 3-ring brown padded Lighthouse binder with matching slipcase. Estimate =	$180.00	$130.00
5658
399	Yugoslavia and Croatia - Yugoslavia #160/770 plus semipostals, Croatia #9/58 plus back of the book. Exhibit-style plasticized presentation pages with typed descriptions featuring a mix of both mint and used, with most mint appearing to be never hinged. The Croatia includes WWII-era souvenir sheets, with not many stamps missing overall (2022 Scott catalogue value = US$544.35). The Yugoslavian material is post-war up to about 1965, with better values including #343-345, 378-384a and totalling 225 stamps, missing only a few items here and there (2022 Scott catalogue value US$338.40). Total 2022 Scott US$882.75 =	$1,191.70	$180.00
5746

Complete run of definitive issues 1967-2003 (less the first set), plus a near complete run of commemoratives with souvenir sheets for the years 1968-1979 arranged on neat homemade pages (stamps inside black mounts) in a red springback album. All stamps appeared to be in perfect NH condition. Great topical interest such as birds, butterflies, ships and fish (among others). Overlooked in their day, these issues have gained appreciation by collectors and catalogue makers alike. 2023 Scott US$739.00 =	$997.65	$260.00
6274
2	Australia #1/125. Organized selection of one hundred and eighteen stamps, mint and (mainly) used on three Hagner stock pages, all identified by the knowledgeable consignor, a long time collector.

5902
4	Australia #J9-J16. First half of the second postage due set, overprinted "Specimen" (the high value was not overprinted, so this actually constitutes a complete run). Mint, with a range of no-gum to lightly hinged, a couple with stamp or album offset. The 3p value has a crease that is visible in the middle left hand side, through the Kangaroo. Still, the appearance is quite fresh. 2018 Stanley Gibbons catalogue value for a complete set of 14 is £1100.00 pro-rata is £550.00 ($946.00 CDN). Estimate =	$200.00	$150.00
3097
5	Australia - Eleven different mint coil pairs issued between 1937-53 (one of the 1/2d Kangaroos is watermarked, the other is not).

All are fresh, relatively well centered and lightly hinged. Includes the 2d KGVI Scarlet, SG 184a. Not listed in Scott catalogue. Total 2018 Stanley Gibbons £554.00 =	$952.88	$150.00

Expect the mint to be hinged, but many of the used stamps have nice cancels. We nted some modern Speciment overprints, plus bit of Australian Antarctic Territory and a few inscription blocks and a stocksheet filled with mint Produce Food strips. About 700 stamps in total. Estimate =	$180.00	$110.00

6283
123	Canada #1372, 1372i. VF mint NH matched sets of the two printings of the 86c Bartlett Pear from the "Fruit Tree" definitive series.

Only 8,500 sheets printed. The original issue price from Canada Post was $54.00 for the unsigned and $89.95 for the signed (suffice to say, most people chose the cheaper version). Note that Unitrade now also lists and values all the various combinations of gutter strips, blocks and plates. The face value of the stamps in these sheets alone is $108.00. When compared to how seldom we see these, they are likely undervalued in Unitrade as sheets. Nice to get both versions at once! 2023 Unitrade =	$275.00	$140.00
6363
126	Canada #2405i. The seldom offered $10.00 "Blue Whale" Uncut press sheet of 9 panes of 2 of the $10.00 engraved wildlife definitive in original tube.

The sheet features 12 booklet panes of 10 "P" value stamps depicting the original 1951 portrait by renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh. The face value of the stamps alone is $110.40, which is more than the original issue price of $102.00 due to the increase in "P" stamp value. 2023 Unitrade =	$205.00	$110.00
6108
130	Canada #3129i. Mint condition uncut press sheet with 9 panes of 4 stamps (36 stamps total) of the $4 Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep 2018 issue.

Almost all different VF mint and used group of 36 Canada Post produced self adhesive "Picture Postage" stamps, mostly "P" values but also including a range of variously denominated stamps. These very limited (often fewer than 100 printed) "custom" issues are quickly becoming the hottest Canadian philatelic collectibles. Take a look at eBay to see what these sell for! Estimate =	$300.00	$150.00
6128
145	Canada - An all-Canadian catch-all, on pages and loose arranged within a small box (about the size of a large shoebox). A real mish-mash of material here, but with MANY better items noted through. Includes (but not limited to)... BC Local Post "Postal Strike" stamps, multiple Elizabethan complete booklets, "back of the book" on Minkus pages with a great showing of postage due / special delivery and OHMS perfins / "G" and "OHMS" overprints, hundreds of late GeoVI / early QEII mint plate blocks and GeoV to QEII mint and used booklet panes. We did not add the face value up, but it would be reasonable to say that there is at least $200.00 of face value alone in the Elizabethan booklets. A great lot needing a sort. Estimate =	$300.00	$500.00
6108
146	Canada - Annual Collections for 1974 & 1975. The two scarcest Canada Post Annual Collections, from the years 1974 and 1975. Very nice quality duo of the key early 8½ x 11 Post Office Yearbooks. Both complete with MNH stamps, the 1975 in sealed plastic sleeve and the 1974 with the original Canada Post envelope. The 1974 year set is the "punched" version, having received the 3-hole punch (as listed in the catalogue). Getting these is increasingly tougher, especially in as nice of shape as these two are. 2023 Unitrade =	$335.00	$90.00
6442

150	Canada - Meticulous modern mint postage lot, nicely mounted on Vario pages (2-4 line) inside 4 "White Ace" brand albums with matching slip cases. Most stamps are from the 12c-$2 denomination, but noted the Millenium set, the 15c Geological sheetlet and the $2 Commonwealth Day issue. All appear to be very fine mint, never hinged condition. While there are several "premium" items and the Vario pages/ albums have significant value, this lot has been valued only by to the usable postage only. Total face value =	$903.08	$550.00
6150
151	Canada - Mint never hinged 1996-2008 "modern" collection housed in matching CWS brand deluxe padded hingeless albums (with slipcases). A colourful period in Canada Post's stamp issuing history, with the beginnings of transitions to both self-adhesive stamps and "P" permanent values. We noted better items, such as souvenir sheets, booklets, die-cuts and a complete set of the Millenium issue stamps. The retail on these albums alone is easily over $200.00. Conservatively valued for the usable face value postage only. Total face value =	$250.08	$180.00
6012
152	Canada Cancels - British Columbia MOON / MOTO cancels on stamp or piece. A choice offering (from the collection of renowned BC postal historian Andrew Scott) arranged alphabetically within TWO 16-page stockbooks. The MOON book boasts 243 postmarks, while the MOTO contains 169 postmarks. An interesting study, which shows (in many cases) the transition of the postmark in the Post Office from MOTO to MOON. The quality of strikes is well-above average for this material which would have taken MANY years to accumulate. Estimate =	$200.00	$180.00

A nice array of cards here, including both early (pre-1920) material up to modern chromes. All are the standard "small" postcard size, with no larger continental size postcards. While most cards are in the $1-$5 range, there are sure to be a few gems lurking throughout. Estimate =	$180.00	$190.00

3850

An attractive lot, which spans the province (but with a clear affinity for the "Kootenay" region). Each item is individually sleeved and priced. Total retail as marked =	$560.00	$160.00
3266
157	Canada Covers - British Columbia 1915-1949 Split Ring Postmarks.

Each item is individually sleeved and priced. Total retail as marked =	$210.00	$75.00
5495
159	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Incoming mail to Victoria 1876-1883, a trio of incoming items mailed from Great Britain to Victoria, in the early days of the province. These historically important items are getting harder to find. A great lot for the historian to piece together the "story behind the cover" on each item. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
5483
160	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postcards. Dealer's stock consisting of 340 postcards, all individually sleeved and arranged within a cardboard "dealer show box". You could almost divide the contents / representation of this lot into "thirds" with 1/3 being Vancouver, 1/3 being Victoria and 1/3 being the "rest of BC". A little bit of everything from classic postcard period (pre-1920) to modern chromes, with all being the standard "small" postcard size (no continental size postcards). A great lot for the collector or show / internet dealer. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
5070
161	Canada Covers - British Columbia. Two batches of cover lots combined into one. Part ONE includes 400 ALL DIFFERENT modern BC hand cancels on #10-sized commercial covers, mostly recent 2015-2016 POCON / RC (retail centre) markings and other specialty types, all being selected strikes. Lots of small towns and new datestamps here, which are not often seen and actually much scarcer than "traditional" earlier postmark material. PART TWO comprises of 300 recent Canadian "WING" cancels on mostly #10-sized covers (15 are #8-sized), mainly 2014-2016 dates. Plus an additional 50 "wings" on piece with strength in Alberta and Quebec. Minor duplication, and although this is a "BC" lot, there are 75 covers and the 50 "wings" on piece from other provinces. Includes the BC wing list from the BC Postal History Study Group. Estimate =	$150.00	$70.00
3208
162	Canada Covers - First Day Covers / British Columbia Postmarks. An interesting and unusual lot of 353 First Day Covers, dated 2000-2002, each bearing an unusual "modern" illustrated cachet and being cancelled from around the province of BC (in particular Vancouver Island). The postmarks in this group are quite interesting, as the collector made a point of travelling to all-ends of the province to acquire postmarks from as many different BC post offices as he could. A huge variety of postmarks, including many "modern" offices and illustrated postmarks which were often only open or used for a short-period. These are totally unchecked and "one of a kind" as they were made by the collector for his own collection. Estimate =	$200.00	$95.00
6150
163	Canada Covers - First Day Covers. A choice mostly-modern FDC accumulation consisting of 532 first day covers from the 2006-2017 period (lightly duplicated). A superior mix of covers, including many "P" values (including the multiple "P" value souvenir sheets) and mixed value souvenir sheets of the time. Conservatively valued at the total face value of the stamps alone (even though these sold at a premium over face value at time of issue). A far "newer" mix than we usually see. Total face value =	$695.81	$290.00
5979
164	Canada Covers - First Day Covers. Accumulation in a small box consisting of 563 Canada Post issued FDC, primarily from the mid-1980's to early 2000's with duplication. We noted a variety of issues here, with many corner block frankings including a stack of "Masterpieces of Canadian Art" 1988 large format FDC with corner blocks. Conservatively valued at the total face value of the stamps alone (even though these sold at a premium over face value at time of issue). Total face value =	$726.01	$190.00
5531
165	Canada Covers - First Day Covers. Collection in 4 older "White Ace" brand binders with black slipcovers. About 330 covers from 1970 to early 2000’s, all housed in 2-pocket Vario pages. The vast majority with Canada Post cachets and unaddressed. We noted an example of the 38c Regiments lower right plate block, a set of the Millenium issue and a cover signed by PE Trudeau (while he was Prime Minister). Significant initial cost and good value in the pages / supplies alone. Estimate =	$200.00	$210.00
1786
166	Canada Covers - Manitoba Postmarks. Comprehensive collection in 7 binders containing 700 covers from 302 towns (no Winnipeg) with CDS, Registered, boxed and roller cancels from (seemingly) every rural post office left open in Manitoba, with about 10 closed offices. The envelopes were sent to Post Offices "undercover" to be mailed back to the sender (W.G. Robinson of Vancouver) with an example of the postmark for his collection. Considerable time and postage went into this assembly. Estimate =	$140.00	$55.00
3619
167	Canada Covers - Postal Stationery. Two deluxe Lighthouse brand 3-ring binders (with slipcases) containing 211 of the 1970's issued illustrated postal stationery postcards. Primarily used, but with favor cancels as these cards have been unbelievably elusive to find legitimately postally used and almost all sets we see are unused. While we have seen favor cancelled sets before, the nice thing about this group is that almost all of the "used" examples are cancelled at Post Offices within the city, town or Province depicted on the illustrated side of the card. The albums alone would also easily retail for over $100.00. Estimate =	$120.00	$160.00
6008
168	Canada Covers - Potpourri of Postal History. A fascinating array of Canadian postal history QV to QEII, offered are received from overseas. Noted many better items such as Small Queens (including registered rates / foreign destinations), First Day Covers, Stamp Dealer Mail, 1c Circular (franked with Canada #14), WWII Military Mail, Northern Postal History, Illustrated Covers, Picture Postcards and Postmarks. There is even an 8c Registered Letter Stamps (F3) on cover, but sadly...it was added at a later date. A total of 148 items, sure to please any postal historian or dealer. Estimate =	$350.00	$425.00
3827
169	Canada Covers - Toronto "Station C" or "Station E" specialized collection of "ORB" postmarks. The "ORB" postmark is a very distinct 2 or 3 ring larger CDS postmark, introduced in the 1890's and seen used into the 1950's. Assembled over my years, this lot comprised of 185 covers or postcards and several pieces / stamps. These are primarily all from the GeoV Admiral period, in which this postmark saw its primary use. The PHSC (Postal History Society of Canada) has a wonderful database of these markings, which are still somewhat readily found in dealer boxes and much cheaper than other distinct postmark types of the period (squared circle, split rings etc). Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3556
170	Canada Covers - Western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) Postcards. Dealer's stock consisting of 325 postcards, all individually sleeved and arranged within a cardboard "dealer show box". A nice variety of cards, from classic period (pre-1920) to the modern chromes, with all being the standard "small" postcard size (no continental size postcards). While most cards are likely in the $1-$5 range, the quantity alone should make this an attractive group for any collector or dealer. Estimate =	$120.00	$130.00
6232
171	Canada Perfins - Commercial (Private) Perfins. Older (and a bit battered) 16-page stock book containing 1,535 duplicated Canadian perfins running alphabetically from B to W. While the reigns represented run from GeoV up through early QEII, there seems to be very decent strength in Admiral issues (including War Tax). Some faults to be expected but the lot seems to be unpicked for perfin positions and varieties, stamp shades or papers etc. Take a good look at the scans to evaluate the scope and overall quality of the lot. Valued at less than 25c per stamp. Estimate =	$325.00	$210.00
6012
172	Canada Precancels - A "Town and City" Type Selection. Lightly duplicated selection of early to mid-20th century "Town and City" type precancels on EdwardVII, GeoV and GeoVI period definitives. Valued by the consignor using the basic 2020 Unitrade catalogue listings (Unitrade doesn't differentiate between bar or town precancels). Some faults noted but completely unchecked for varieties or better towns. Owner's 2020 Unitrade =	$358.30	$120.00
3612
173	Canada Precancels - Dealer’s stock, Queen Victoria to 1970’s, with strength in King George V issues. Include "bars", many different town types and MOON numbered overprints. Arranged within a small box, the group includes a mounted collection in a springback album, a stockbook and some loose pages and a shoebox worth of glassines and "102 cards" that haven’t seen the light of day in over 40 years (saw stamps priced at 2c each!). A look indicates that there is potential here for the dedicated hunter. Estimate =	$200.00	$210.00
6379
174	Canada Precancels - Precancel collection of 575 different stamps, mounted on Hagner stockpages. Includes some "Bars" (#T82, T-75-VD, T79, D-35). Amongst the town issues there are $3-$10 items everywhere, but noted Moncton 2-116-D (cat $200), Montreal 2-95, 3-91, Kitchener 1-119, Ottawa "ND" perfin P3-110 (cat $100), and many MOON styles. Condition is a bit mixed, but this is a great lot to start from, or to fill holes. Estimate =	$250.00	$600.00
5567
175	Canada Precancels - Two Volume Precancel Hoard. Thousands of semi-sorted duplicated precancels, housed in two stockbooks, ranging from nicely varied Victorian era roller types, up through numerous bar types (including modern) and a huge quantity of city types. The first stockbook contains pages of roller and bar types as well as the city types mostly for Montreal, Toronto and Quebec (but still saw smaller quantities of other cities in the mix). The second stockbook contains alphabetically organized city types (Brandon to Woodstock). Offered as received from a European source, the lot appears to be completely unpicked. Decades of careful accumulation here, and as such this material should prove to be a goldmine for the general precancel collector, the precancel variety specialist and the precancel dealer looking for fresh and "new to the market" stock. Sure to be finds here for the intrepid precancel student. Estimate =	$600.00	$425.00
5958

Clean and well organized all used duplicated (1 to 10 of each) stock of 36 different Federal Unemployment Insurance stamps. 212 stamps in total, 1941 to 1955 period issues.

5106
179	Canada Revenues #MW1, MW1c. City of Winnipeg Wildlife Conservation stamp. Complete MNH sheet of 100 of the 1967 issue turquoise Canada Goose stamp.

Problematic mint and used quartet of pence issue imperfs, consisting of #1 (mint no gum, thinned), #3 (mint no gum corner crease), #5 (used, thinned) and #8 (mint no gum, close cut).

3634
183	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #78/103. Selection of twenty-six mainly Mint hinged (a few NH also noted) stamps in mostly F/VF condition. The Guy issue (1910) is not quite complete, missing the 6c and the 10c from both the lithographed and engraved issues as well as the 12c. A few perf varieties from the 1910 issue are also included. A very attractive group in unusually attractive appearance and condition. Consignor's 2019 Scott US$1,027.00 =	$1,386.45	$190.00
6035
184	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #145-159, 163-171, 172-182. The three 1928-1931 issues complete in mint Hinged mainly VF condition. Thirty-six stamps, including #148a. Nice to get them all at once, especially in this condition. Consignor's 2019 Scott US$517.85 =	$699.10	$95.00
6012
185	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C2, C2a. Fine Mint lightly-hinged examples of the 1919 Alcock-Brown "Trans Atlantic Air Post 1919, One Dollar" overprinted airmail issues showing both the "comma after Post" and "no comma after Post" variety. A nice duo, accompanied by a hand-written write up done by the original owner. 2022 Scott US$450.00 =	$607.50	$170.00
6108
186	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C3. Clean example of the 1921 "Airmail to Halifax N.S. 1921" overprinted airmail issue on first flight cover, destined for Halifax. The first flight left Botwood, but ran into engine troubles which forced an emergency landing. On restarting the plane, the Pilot (Major Cotton) was injured and the remainder of the flight was cancelled, with the mail sent by train (and ship) to Halifax. Attractively written up on album page. 2022 Scott Specialized US$225.00 =	$303.75	$65.00

3811
188	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C12. VF used example of the 1932 "Dornier Do-X" overprinted airmail issue. The surcharge, applied to the C11 "Historic Flights" issue was limited to only 8000 copies, with used examples (in our opinion) being tougher to acquire than their Mint counterpart. Attractively written up on the original owner’s album page. 2023 Unitrade for VF used is $450.00. 2023 Scott US$275.00 =	$371.25	$190.00
6108

5112
195	Ethiopia #M1-M2. Wholesale dealer lot of pair and blocks, with a few singles. All appear to be mint, never hinged and well centered, but a number of gum bends are noted. Of particular note are the two low values from the Italian Occupation issue, in which there are 146 copies of M1 (cat $16.00 each) and 99 copies of M2 (cat $14.00 each). Attractive and great potential for online sales or show dealers. Total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$3722.00 =	$5,024.00	$270.00
3634
196	Faroe Islands #3/720. Hingeless Davo album (with slipcase) with pages to 2017 features a very complete, mostly used collection (exceptions are #6 and issues up to about 1983). From 1983 onwards, the used stamps are almost exclusively with first day cancels (as available for order from the Post Office at the time). The album has very few empty spaces and the stamps are clean in every aspect. 2023 Scott catalogue value US$1632.90 =	$2,204.40	$210.00
5263
197	Faroe Islands #7/408. Complete run of year sets from 1975-2001, most in original plastic sleeve. Includes sets and singles but no booklet stamps.

6466
198	Faroe Islands #7/640. First Day Cover collection in Post Office branded Davo 2-post albums with cardboard slipcases. Magnificent, very complete run including souvenir sheets on cacheted, unaddressed covers. Where there is duplication, it is usually because of singles and complete sets being represented. A couple are signed (awaits your research). The stamp value of some of the more recent items is up to $25 a cover. Enormous catalogue value here, with a total 489 covers. Estimated at just over $1 per cover, which would be a fraction of the catalogue value. Estimate =	$500.00	$210.00
3208
199	Faroe Islands #8/770. Post Office issued postcards and Maxi-cards in 5 matching red Unisafe postcard albums with slipcases covering the period of 1975-2018.

A grand total of 212 maxi-cards with stamp tied by First Day Cancel and 140 mint cards with neither stamps nor cancels. Minor duplication. Excellent, fresh condition. The stamps have significant catalogue value. Estimate =	$220.00	$95.00

3613
202	Faroe Islands #121/231. Complete panes of 20 stamps in a complete run for the period. Panes are in Mint never-hinged condition and arranged in 1-pocket Vario album pages housed in a black Lighthouse binder with matching slipcase. 2023 Scott US$3217.00 =	$4,342.95	$210.00
2299
203	Faroe Islands #186/571. Run of 1989-2011 large-size annual folders, with more elaborate descriptions of each stamp issued. Quite similar to what most countries offer in current annual soft-cover collection. The stamps appear to have been added to the mounts and appear to be in perfect condition.

Noted better including the "Sealife" issues and #423 (to name a few). All appear to be Post Office fresh, with crisp colours being stowed away since the time of issue. The catalogue values of these panes really adds up quickly. Total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$4263.00 =	$5,755.05	$260.00
2299
206	Faroe Islands #409/720. Mint NH stamps featured in soft-cover year set folders, complete run 2002-2018, includes souvenir sheets but not booklets. Many have been opened, but the overall condition seems excellent. 2023 Scott US$1493.70 =	$2,016.50	$280.00
6384
207	Faroe Islands #454/593. The 2005-2007 issues in complete Mint NH panes of 20, then 2008-2012 issues in blocks of four (the collector’s wallet may have had enough of the ever-increasing issues...and cost), but there are also some souvenir sheets from the period to make up for it. Stamps are in the condition as if they left the Post Office yesterday and are housed in 1-3 pocket Vario brand pages. Enormous initial cost. Total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$3573.00 =	$4,823.55	$270.00

Includes SEPAC (Small European Postal Administration Cooperation) joint issues from 2007-2018. Finishes with mint and CTO machine issue labels (not listed in Scott, but given everything else from this time period, likely has a high face value).

4741
210	Faroe Islands - Post Office cancels and Picture Postcards (plus some extras). An intriguing collections which features 40 covers each cancelled from a different small town, most with matching registration label (circa 1980) and a matching set of postcards depicting 40 towns (we didn’t check each one, but they are likely the same 40 towns).

211	Fiume #27-43. Complete Mint hinged set of the 1919 issued patriotic series featuring scenes of "Italian Flag on Clock Tower in Fiume", "Revolution" and "Sailor Raising Italian Flag at Fiume". We note that a few of these appear to be some of the Scott listed paper varieties (often with a higher catalogue value). The 10c stamp has a light thin from hinge, mentioned for the record. Catalogued as regular issue stamps only. 2022 Scott US$266.00 =	$359.10	$55.00
2712
212	France #14/397, J3/J10, M2/M9, P7/P8, N2, B2/B88, C5/C16. Taken from old style Scott representative World Wide album housing issues to 1940, these thirteen pages of used stamps (a few MH) are not complete but are still very comprehensive and represent a major contribution to a full collection of this classic philatelic period. The "Back of the Book" issues are somewhat less complete than the regular issues but the collection does offer the seldom seen #N2. Consignor's 2019 Scott US$1,448.10=	$1,954.94	$325.00
6466
213	France #2168. Fluorescent Paper Variety. VF mint NH example of the 1989 issue "Philex-France" souvenir sheet, printed on the rare fluorescent paper. This variety is recognized by all the major catalogues including Scott (see footnotes). This paper type usually appeared in sheets that were packaged in Post Office collector's packs destined for foreign countries, and as such were scattered to the four corners of the globe. We don't get these often. 2023 Scott US$400.00 =	$540.00	$70.00
3938
214	France #C8-C13, C27, C34-C36, C37-C40. All mint NH selection of 14 different 1936 to 1960 period airmails. While the #C27 has a few handling bends, the balance are all perfect VF mint NH. A colourful and fresh group. Owner's 2023 Scott US$ 451.00 =	$608.85	$75.00

3543
216	German States Baden #7. Used accumulation of the 1853 issue 3 Kreuzer black on green paper. 104 stamps in total, unchecked for varieties or better postmarks (these 5-ring numeral postmarks are very popular and collectable). Expect a few faults in the mix but better items could be lurking. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,456.00 =	$1,965.60	$65.00
2299
217	German States Baden #8.

The crisp and legible "UEBERLINGEN 4 JAN '65" postmark, as well as the "SCHAFER" guarantee handstamp add significantly to the used value and appeal of this German State classic and the "ist echt" Stegmuller photo certificate is the "icing on the cake". Valued in the 2019 Michel catalogue at 3,200 euros (= $4,720.00 CAD). This stamp will be at home in any top flight German collection and is, needless to say, missing from most German area collections we see. 2023 Scott Classic US$2,250.00 =	$3,037.50	$325.00
4189
219	Germany - Afrika Korps Feldpost. Michel #5a.

4877
220	Germany - Bankers Box of covers / postcards 1960's to 1990's (with a few earlier) including a wide variety of frankings and rates (with many to Canada). Assembled over many years by a traditional stamp collector (not necessarily a cover collector), these were deemed to be "more interesting" and therefore, worth keeping. There are likely over 2000 items here, surely with some hidden gems to be found by the patient sorter. Conservatively estimated at less than 8c per cover! Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00
3208
221	Germany - DDR / Berlin - Late 1960's to early 1980's batch of First Day Covers and special event / postmark covers.

222	Germany - Kurland - Michel #1-3, 4A, 4B.

The issue date of these Military stamps is April 20th 1945 and the war ended shortly thereafter. Each and every of these stamps has the appropriate guarantee handstamp. Great to get them all at once, especially Never Hinged and authenticated. 2019 Michel catalogue 250.00 euros =	$370.00	$170.00
5742
223	Germany - Postal History Accumulation. Small box containing 475 covers and postcards, primarily from the 1890's to 1950's with a wide array of frankings, rates and usages.

A great lot for a show or internet dealer to break apart, or for a collector of postal history to bolster their holdings while having the fun of sorting at the same time. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
3208

1837
226	Great Britain #96, 108-109. Sound and F/VF used trio of large format 1883-1884 issue Queen Victoria high values, consisting of the 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine.

3634
258	Greenland #102/799. Complete run of smaller format year sets from 1977-2018. Includes some souvenir sheets, but no booklet stamps. There might be a few minor faults to some of the folders, but the stamps appear to be in perfect condition. A great way to build a modern Greenland collection, with the bonus being that the folders provide information to help increase your knowledge of the stamps, culture and geography of the world’s largest non-continental island. Total 2023 Scott US$2353.80 =	$3,175.96	$220.00
4389
259	Greenland #233/389. First day covers spanning 1991-2001. A nearly complete run for the period consisting of 158 mostly different first day covers (duplication is usually where there is a set of singles, then one cover with the entire set). Noted "famous men", whales, art (to name a few). Excellent condition, all in a three-ring Scott Specialty album with matching slipcase. Estimate =	$200.00	$160.00
6008
260	Greenland #358/631. Mint collection of blocks of various sizes and quantities, issued between 2000-2012 (after 2008 most issues are down to a single block... not surprising given the significant cost to keep up this level of acquisition). Includes the Art, mining, tourism issues, along with some souvenir sheets. Nicely displayed on 2, 3 or 4-pocket Vario stockpages, with most identified by both Scott and Facit, all in a solid three-ring Scott Specialty binder with matching slipcase. A great way to build a collection or to break up and sell. 2023 Scott US$5337.00 =	$7,474.95	$350.00
3634
261	Greenland #B1/B44. Semi-Postals, near complete up to 2015 with mint (singles and blocks, all never hinged), used (most cancelled to order), with souvenir sheets and matching first day covers.

6008
262	Greenland - Assorted single issue presentation packs or year folders issued between 1978-2014. We counted 45 assorted issues, including the 2-volume "Ships" issues. Many of the packs have been opened and the stamps have been put into the mounts. Includes an attractive example of a softcover book: "Stories of Greenland Stamps". The original post office cost of these folders would be substantial. Estimate =	$160.00	$65.00
2299
263	Greenland - Group of "Polar Bear" parcel post stamps. Lot includes 4 original stamps which are Q4B (mint), Q6 (mint and used) and Q6a (mint) along with reprint sheets from the 1980’s and more modern issues, including souvenir sheets and a recent post office booklet. Additional material includes some maxi-cards, first day covers and some cancels on piece and cover. Lot concludes with 16 Gentolfe Cinderella label sheets (a neighbourhood in Copenhagen, Denmark, that apparently has close ties to Greenland) issued between 1982-1990. Estimate =	$180.00	$190.00

Estimate =	$250.00	$290.00
2060
265	Greenland and Faroe Islands - A couple hundred used on stamp/piece, most 1990-2010 and most from Post Office mailings, so the stamps are in good shape and nicely cancelled. We noted many better values with catalogue values above $30.00 each (such as #249 and 497). Expect some duplication, but an excellent group to build a collection, or keep what you want and then make circuit books, online sales, etc. Estimate =	$130.00	$110.00
6466
266	Hong Kong #3/414, J1/J10. Hong Kong Hoard. Duplicated mint and (mostly) used group of 302 stamps, 1862 to 1983 period issues, definitives and commemoratives. All laid out in chronological order on Hagner brand stock sheets. While some faults can be expected, the lot is completely unchecked for varieties or better postmarks. Take a good look at the scans. Owner's 2024 Scott US$3,440.15 =	$4,644.20	$475.00
4475
267	Hong Kong #168, 170, 175. Trio of George VI issues in Mint NH singles, blocks and part sheets, likely put away at time of issue, or survived at the Post Office (in the case of the 1941 issues), during the WWII Japanese occupation. Includes 36x #168, 170x #170 and 172x #175. Generally VF NH, but noted a couple minor bends, but also includes selvedge and inscription examples. Catalogued as regular stamps only.

6255

3208
270	Iceland #870/1362. Larger sized year folders (annual collections), a complete run of 16 from 1999-2014, including souvenir sheets. While there might be a couple of minor faults with the folders themselves, the stamps appear to be in great condition. A great way to build a modern Icelandic collection, with no premium for the year sets. Total 2023 Scott US$1248.55 =	$1,685.54	$160.00
4472
271	India #203-206. Mint hinge-remnant set of the "In Memoriam" issue for what would have been the 80th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, issued one year after his death. Very attractive, but with hinge remnants, and in the process of trying to remove the hinge from the 10R value, caused a small thin at the top. Still a fresh looking set, one of the key issues of India. 2023 Scott US$557.50 =	$752.63	$110.00
4707
272	Indochina #B8-B13. Complete Mint hinged set of the 1919 surcharged "Orphans of War" charity issue. Post Office fresh colour, a seldom-seen "French Colony" OVPT semi postal set. 2023 Scott US$242.35 =	$327.17	$150.00

A few of the early issues are hinged, but the vast majority are never hinged. All housed in 2-volumes with over 100 x 2-5 pocket Vario-brand pages (significant value in the pages alone). A fresh and very complete offering for the period covered. Estimate =	$200.00	$160.00
6255
274	Israel #321/962 plus Back of the Book. Selection of 400 different First Day Covers, very complete from 1968-87 and then a bit thinner until 1990. All are cacheted and unaddressed. Nicely arranged on over 100 Vario 2-pocket pages, and housed in 3 volumes (1 is a Scott Specialized binder). The "as new" cost of the supplies alone in this lot is close to $200. A very clean offering. Estimate =	$160.00	$110.00
4466
275	Italy Aegean Islands - Rhodes #15-23. Fresh, sound and VF mint OG H/HR complete 1929 "Visit of the King and Queen to the Aegean Islands" commemorative set of 10. 2023 Scott US$458.50 =	$618.98	$130.00

276	Italy Triese #Q10. Mint NH example of the 200 Lira parcel post intact pair, with 2-line overprint "AMG FTT", issued under the Allied Military Government for a Free Trieste just after World War II. This is one of the key issues from this time period. Never hinged, but with an owner’s or authentication mark on the reverse. Very minor toning at the right-hand side. 2023 Scott US$575.00 =	$776.25	$50.00
2271
277	Laos #1/706 plus Back of the Book. Enticing 4-volume collection and exhibit of mostly very-fine mint never hinged material including sheetlets and sets (both perf and imperf), supplemented by first day covers. Some work will be needed to put order to this collection, but much has been identified by Scott numbers with some minor duplication. We noted many Vario brand 1-5 strip black pages used, which add to the value of this lot from a "supplies" viewpoint. A somewhat under-appreciated corner of South-East Asia, which has been growing in popularity over the years. Estimate =	$300.00	$625.00
93
278	Laos - Selection of 26 sheetlets extracted from Presentation Booklets, 2 sunken die proofs, 4 deluxe proofs, 2 souvenir sheets, one imperforate strip with colour trials and three presentation booklets from 1964 with souvenir sheets which were different printings from the regular issues.

Estimate =	$200.00	$200.00
4064
279	Lebanon #220-224, C141-145. 1948 UNESCO imperforate souvenir sheet on thin card (ungummed), with Arabic and French inscriptions. A striking piece, in excellent condition. Seldom seen and mentioned in Scott as a footnote to C145. 2023 Scott US$250.00 =	$337.50	$160.00

4741
282	Namibia #659/966. Nearly complete offering of 1990’s Namibia, soon after it emerged from Southwest Africa. Lot includes a collection of mint never hinged singles, sets and souvenir sheets, as well as a substantial number of sheetlets of 10 or corner blocks. These issues are rife with topical interest including fish, trains, fossils, lunar new year and animals. Better sets include the 1997 definitives and the Hong Kong takeover. There are also a number of booklets (some CTO), presentation packs and over 100 first day covers. Nicely housed in two 4-ring tan coloured Lighthouse binders with slip cases (worth over $100 retail alone). Total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$1,040.80 =	$1,405.08	$350.00
6482
283	New Zealand #51/139. Almost all used specialized collection of 72 stamps (#73 is MNH), Victorian and Edwardian period issues, all mounted on 17 computer generated album pages. Expect the odd small fault in the earlies. Varieties have been noted in the 1st and 2nd issues of "Sidefaces" and the 1st pictorials have been identified into London and local printings. Also included are detailed study pages of the 1d "Dominion" issues with the owner's four page write-up identifying printings. Much of the EdwardVII material has been separated into various shades and perfs. All valued by the consignor by 2018 Scott catalogue. Owner's 2018 Scott US$544.65=	$735.28	$95.00
4172

An additional section of 1999 to 2010 period issues are all laid out on Vario brand stock sheets.

Documentation in the lot includes a write-up on the "Round Kiwi " issue. All valued by the consignor using the 2018 Scott catalogue. Owner's 2018 Scott US$1,500.00 =	$2,025.00	$120.00
5841
285	Poland - The 2nd Polish Corps in Italy 1946. Group of 3 Mint souvenir sheets, comprising 1 Lire, 3 Lire and 5 Lire single value sheets. The stamp element of the sheets are Mint NH, but the sheets themselves have some margin faults (in particular the 1L value). Not listed in Scott, but catalogue by Sassone (2004) at 400 Euros ($585.88 CDN). Estimate =	$140.00	$55.00
1858
286	Portugal #2/748. Mint hinged and used selection of 1853-1952 period issues running from the early imperfs up to early 1950s commemoratives. 33 stamps in total, all laid out and catalogued on one stocksheet.

4764
287	Rhodesia #3/140. All Mint hinged (including a few NH) duplicated selection of 44 1890-1917 period issues, consisting of 1890-1894 "Coat of Arms" types and the 1913 to 1917 GeoV "Admiral" types. Includes lots of perf varieties and shades. Expect the odd small fault. A good group for further specialist inspection. Owner's 2021 Scott US$622.75 =	$840.71	$50.00
6274
288	Saint Kitts Nevis #1/74, MR1-MR2. Almost all different mint Hinged and used selection of 1903 to 1935 period EdwardVII and GeoV issues, all laid out, identified and priced on one Hagner stock sheet. Saw values to 10sh and other useful singles. 2023 Scott US$359.65=	$485.53	$140.00
6286
289	Saint Lucia #2, 3. Fresh and sound used examples of the 1860 issue 4p blue and 6p green Victorias, both watermark 5 (small star). A tough early classic caribbean duo. 2023 Scot US$400.00 =	$540.00	$140.00
3683
290	Saint Lucia #6/194, MR1-MR2. Mint and used 95% different 1863 to 1964 period selection of 66 stamps, all laid out, identified and valued on two Hagner brand stock sheets. The lot includes a thinned mint #4 which is not counted in the total. Except for the off small fault in the balance of the lot, the condition tends to be fresh and F/VF. Almost all of the catalogue value is in GeoV, EdwardVII and Victorian era material. 2023 Scott US$718.50=	$969.88	$110.00
6466
291	Saint Lucia #17, 19, 20, 22, 23. Colourfully fresh and sound used quintet of 1881 to 1884 engraved Queen Victoria issues, both watermark 1 (Crown and CC) and watermark 2 (Crown and CA) types. An eye-catching selection! 2023 Scott Classic US$333.50 =	$450.23	$130.00
5495
292	Saint Lucia #27/39, 27a/37a, 40a, 41, 42. Almost all CDS used (#27a is mint and #39 has a revenue cancel, so not counted in total) selection of 21 different 1983 to 1898 period issues. All organized by the collector for the "A" and "B" Die types with a trio of provisional surcharges to round out the group. 2023 Scott Classic US$284.10=	$383.54	$44.00
1496

2299
294	Saint Vincent #1/60. A two stock page offering of 51 lightly duplicated mint and used 1861 to 1897 period Victorian era issues. All organized, identified and valued by the consignor. Note a very interesting range of cancels, including CDS, numerals and the "GB 40c" types. An "old-time" holding and a quality offering for the collector of classic Caribbean material. 2023 Scott US$2,437.75=	$3,290.96	$375.00
3543
295	Saint Vincent #32. Sound and Fine used 1881 issue "ONE PENNY" surcharge on 6p yellow green Victoria. Nice light CDS postmark. 2023 Scott US$400.00 =	$540.00	$190.00

6372
297	South Africa RSA - Collection of 270 First Day Covers 1961-1991 (with the majority being from the 1970's / 1980's), accumulated within a small box. There are two specialized South Africa FDC albums, one being filled with covers and the other empty (with presumably the loose covers in the box being intended to fill it). A nice range of topical issues throughout, as is typical of the colorful issues from South Africa of this time period. Estimate =	$120.00	$95.00
6128
298	Sweden - Used 19th Century Selection. All used selection of 28 different 1858 to 1879 period issues consisting of both the "Coat of Arms" and "Numeral of Value" types. Includes several perf varieties. Expect the odd small fault in the mix. Owner's 2021 Scott US$ 1,098.50 =	$1,482.98	$90.00

300	Switzerland - Cover / FDC / Postcard / Maximum Card HOARD Part 1. U-haul box filled with albums containing a total of 935 covers or cards (plus an additional 232 stamps, mostly in sets). Includes cachet FDC, special event covers, illustrated postmarks and first flight covers. There is also a wide array of topical interest including space, trains, ships, animals, mountaineering etc. Primarily 1970's to 1990's material, but with the odd item mixed in throughout that does not fall into that period. All items are neatly arranged and stored within cover albums of various makes (worth a bit on their own!). Enormous catalogue value in the stamps alone (especially if done by the Swiss Zumstein catalogue). Conservatively estimated at less than 20 cents per item. Estimate =	$180.00	$130.00
5979
301	Switzerland - Cover / FDC / Postcard / Maximum Card HOARD Part 2. U-haul box filled with 10 albums and a single shoebox, all stuffed with First Day Covers from the 1950's to 1990's with the majority from the latter period. A grand total of 992 covers, including an attractive prepared collection of 1980's / 1990's "Feldpost" cachet covers. A nice showing of topical material, with most covers bearing blocks or full sets for each issue. As with the previous lot, the stamps alone would add up tremendously by catalogue value. Conservatively estimated at less than 20c per item. Estimate =	$180.00	$130.00
5979
302	Switzerland / Supplies - Two green Lighthouse brand 4-ring cover albums (with matching slipcases) filled with 320 Swiss First Day Covers from 1982-2000. The First Day Covers are in excellent condition, with a wide range of topical interest issues as the Switzerland Post Office is well-known for producing, often in sets or blocks rather than singles. The alums themselves would easily retail for over $100.00. A nice clean lot. Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00
4466
303	Tannu Tuva #15-28, 29-34, 45a-52a, C1-9. Choice group of four different Mint hinged sets including the 1927 Pictorials, 1932 "Romanization of the Alphabet" surcharges, 1934 Pictorials (imperforate Scott listed variety) and the 1934 Airmail issue. Fresh colours throughout, with stunning imagery as found on the stamps of this Republic. 2023 Scott US$218.30 =	$294.71	$120.00
2712
304	Tobago #1/26. Used (and a few mint no gum) selection of 11 different 1879 to 1896 period Victorian era issues including the first issues and better surcharges. An elusive assemblage. 2023 Scott US$601.60=	$812.16	$220.00
5560
305	Turks, Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands #1/977 plus War Tax. Dealer stock on 22 manilla stocksheets. There is some Victorian-era material, but the best is post 1970 with blocks and souvenir sheets. There is a bit of duplication. All pages have Scott numbers to aid organization and identification. Over 1000 stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$65.00
6466
306	United Nations #465b/587 plus Scott unlisted. Vienna-issued "Personalized Postage" label sheets from 2007 to 2016. Interestingly, the first few issues are not numbered by Scott, as they indicate in notes where the sheets would be listed, but there is evidence that the sheets were never issued out of Vienna. Interesting enough, as then the Scott catalogue goes onto describe the sheet and price it! Sometimes the themes overlap the New York issues, sometimes they don’t. A few of these issues had up to three printings, most of which are included here. A few of the sheets also come with a matching CTO equivalent. Overall, in excellent condition, and quite scarce as indicated by the total catalogue value. 2023 Scott US$1605.00 =	$2,166.75	$75.00
5577
307	United Nations #857a. The 2003 New York "Personalized Postage" label sheets, with 10x 37c stamps and a matching label. All described and priced in Scott, some within footnotes. Very scarce material that had a high original selling price, which often scared / discouraged collectors at the time of issue. Includes a) the basic sheet b) 1 sheet with personalized photos included (unavailable through mail-in service, you had to buy them at the New York office in person) c) Hong Kong Stamp Expo (1000 produced) d) Essen Stamp Show e) "My visit to New York" (a generic sheet that was always stamped CTO). All in excellent condition. Total 2023 Scott US$620.00 =	$837.00	$42.00
5531
308	United Nations #884a. Pair of mint 2005 issue 80c rate "Personalized Postage" label sheets. As often happens with these trial printings, the second issue is even scarcer. One sheet is the basic sheet, the other was issued for the Riccione Italy stamp show. Both sheets are in great shape and very scarce modern New York issues. 2023 Scott US$525.00 =	$708.75	$50.00
5577
309	United Nations #902a/929. Half-dozen "Personalized postage" label sheets issued out of New York in 2006-2007. Each sheet with 10 stamps and 10 labels, with either 39c or 84c denominations. These sheets are noted and priced in the footnotes of Scott catalogue. Includes themes of Peace, the Washington and Berlin Philatelic Exhibitions and the Anniversary of Japan’s accession to the UN. Overlooked at the time, these are in great shape and missing from many UN collections. Total 2023 Scott US$662.50 =	$894.38	$42.00
5531
310	United Nations #934/991d. Group of 14 different "Personalized postage" labels issued between 2007-2009 from the New York office, including the basic sheets, as well as specialty issues for Pope Benedict, Climate Change, the Beijing Olympics, etc. These sheets had a significant selling price above the face value of the stamps, plus they are an oversized item which made collector's shy away from them at the time (hence making them tough to find now). Total 2023 Scott US$634.50 =	$856.58	$42.00
5531
311	United Nations #994/1054. Sheets of 2009-2013 "Personalized Postage" labels issued from New York, includes two shades of printing of #994, Lunar New Year (Tiger, Rabbit), Dogs, Law of the Sea, Tinkerbell and Manila Declaration. Some of the sheets include both a mint and a CTO example. Massive initial cost when purchased at the time. Not a lot of these floating around the open market. In great shape, carefully stowed away since purchased at time of issue. Total 2023 Scott US$596.00 =	$804.60	$65.00
5531
312	United Nations #1054/1136. Group of "Personalized Postage" label sheets issued from New York between 2013-2016. With 10 stamps and 10 generic labels with personalization only available through an in-person visit to New York headquarters. Many of these sheets were also issued for themes including CITES (x3), Lunar New Year (Horse, Monkey), Pope Francis, UNESCO and even "Angry Birds" (not sure if this fits into a bird thematic). These oversized sheets are in excellent condition, carefully stowed away since time of issue. Total 2023 Scott US$795.00 =	$1,073.25	$42.00

313	United Nations - 1950's-1970's FDC Collections, neatly arranged / mounted on pages within 5 albums in a bankers box. We noted a wide array of issues (including the high catalogue value 1955 souvenir sheet), with many being blocks or corner blocks. Almost all (if not all) are cachet First Day Covers, with illustrated envelopes which are more sought after and showcase the issue. Two of these albums still have the original dealer's price tag of $180.00 for the pair, so our estimate will seem quite reasonable when you consider there are 5 albums total in the lot! Estimate =	$120.00	$24.00

319	United Nations - Endangered Species singles and blocks on First Day Covers. The 1993-2015 issues, from all three stamp issuing entities.

The "show cards" depict the theme of the show, a feature of the host city, or the stamp being issued in conjunction with that show. These are then often first day cancelled and feature show cachets along with the featured stamp for that show (most are NY issues). In great shape and housed in 2 black UniSafe brand postcard albums with matching slipcases. Estimate =	$130.00	$65.00
5531

Collection housed in 13 volumes, each with 16 first day covers all cacheted and unaddressed. Pristine as virtually untouched since the day of production. A grand total of 208 covers plus the albums.

In each year the booklet had six panes, which have been expertly exploded, and pleasingly displayed on Vario stock pages within a blue Lighthouse brand 4-ring album with slipcase. There is one set each of issues for Climate Change and One Planet. The value is almost perfectly split between the three issuing entities. Total 2023 Scott catalogue value US$888.00 =	$1,198.80	$46.00
2712
332	United Nations - Geneva and Vienna - Geneva #1/581 and Vienna #1/566. A definitive study/hoard in two volumes.

The Vienna has 53 First Day Covers and newer issues with a face value of €105.00 ($154.00 CDN). All mint stamps are believed to be never hinged. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
6447
333	United Nations - Geneva and Vienna - Geneva: Large lot of post cards including 60 "maxi-cards" issued 1991-2001 (about one half of the cards come with a mint card with no stamp or cancel), and 120 cards for mostly European philatelic show and a striking imprint of the UN logo in gold leaf and cancelled for the show (where there is a bit of duplication, it’s usually because of cancels on different days of the show). Most produced between 1991-2005. Vienna: The same, but 30 maxi-cards, and 166 philatelic exhibition cards. All housed in 5 Unisafe postcard albums with 2-pocket pages (binders are grey (2) and burgundy (3), each with matching slipcase). Significant effort and cost to accumulate these 376 cards.

5531
334	United Nations - New York #1/1111. Two-volume specialized definitive collection. Includes singles, blocks, plate blocks, additional printings, plate flaws all nicely supported with First Day Covers. About half of this offering is from the first issue alone! Almost every mint stamp is never hinged. Well displayed on black stockpages in a pair of three-ring blue "G&K" brand binders with matching slipcovers. Conservatively valued for the face value alone, but worth considerably more. Total Face Value US$230.00 =	$310.50	$110.00
6447
335	United Nations - New York #12/1125. Collection of commemorative issues from 1952-2016.

6447
336	United Nations - New York #63/1123. New York issues from 1958-2015 on First Day Covers with Geneva cachets and cancels. Presumably started before Geneva was issuing its own stamps, but still wanted a philatelic role. The first few cachets are subtle, with the difference being the use of French (or being bilingual) but by the early 1960s, the cachets explicitly stated "Geneva Cachet". There is a bit of duplication, but given this collector had an eye for detail, there may be subtle differences. Most covers are small sized, cacheted, mostly unaddressed. Some of the more recent have souvenir sheets. A total of 450 covers housed in THREE 4-ring Lighthouse brand binders with matching slipcovers. Estimate =	$200.00	$46.00
5531
337	United Nations - New York #69/1123. Near complete run of Annual Year Folders issued between 1959-2015 (missing only 1963 and 1992). The first year, the stamps were stuck to the card, but the following year clear mounts were added and from that point onwards the stamps are all found in their mounts (and are presumably never hinged). Includes regular issues and souvenir sheets, but no booklets, prestige products or personalized stamp issues. Very difficult to accumulate set of folders. Overall condition is excellent. Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
6447
338	United Nations - Vienna and Geneva - Generic cacheted first day covers with cancels from the respective "Museum". Followed by a second set of first day covers with "Work Day" first day cancels, and slogan cancels. These were issued between the 1970’s up until 1990 and are likely to be a very complete offering of this niche. Most of the covers are cacheted and most unaddressed. Housed in 4 burgundy Lighthouse 200 cover FDC albums with slipcovers (these alone retail at $280.00!). Overall condition is excellent. Estimate =	$200.00	$36.00

Conservatively valued for the face value alone, which is in excess 500.00 Swiss francs. 500CHF (Swiss Francs) =	$770.00	$150.00
6447
342	United Nations Offices in Vienna #1/576. Complete run of 37 Year Set folders. Stamps have been put in the mounts inside the folders which include definitives, commemoratives and souvenir sheets, but no booklets, prestige or personalized postage products.

6447
343	United Nations Offices in Vienna #7/578. Very complete hoard of commemorative issues in blocks of 4-10, supplemented with sheetlets and souvenir sheets, missing only some of the recurring & prestige issues. All appear to be very fine, mint never hinged examples. Perfect to build from, or to break-up for sale online. Lovingly displayed on Vario stockpages in a 4-ring black Lighthouse brand binder with matching slipcase. We did not count it, but there is an enormous amount of face value / original cost in this lot. Total 2023 Scott US$2501.60 =	$3,377.16	$325.00
6447

The Lighthouse binders and pages would retail for over $200.00 alone. Estimate =	$250.00	$55.00
5531

6014
348	USA - Collector's assembly of "earlies" up to 2010, somewhat chronologically arranged within two 64-page Lighthouse brand stockbooks. Somewhat mixed condition in the earlier material, but does include a nice used "Black Jack" among others. Noted some "back of the book" material including stationery cut-squares and revenues.

3543
349	USA - The 1976 Revolutionary War Bicentennial holding in 9-volumes filling a small U-Haul box. Includes a number of commemorative covers with cachets, cancels or first day of issue (including specialized collections made by Fleetwood). With topicals such as events, people, battles, towns/locations etc. The lot concludes with a collection of stamps and souvenir sheets, mostly mint never hinged. While primarily USA issues, many of the stamps and some of the covers in this lot were issued by other countries. Good time to get on-board with this as the 250th anniversary is only three years away! Estimate =	$140.00	$24.00
2060
350	USA Covers - A collector's accumulation of 103 American Navy Ship (USS) cancelled covers and postcards. A nice array of pre-WWII, WWII and more "recent" with emphasis placed on the tidiness of both the cover and postmark. Noted a variety of usages including visits abroad, anniversaries, Navy Day, Easter and George Washington's birthday (to name a few). Once of the most enticing features of this lot is how many different ships are represented here and the historical timeline of events as shown through the cachets and postmarks. A great lot for the history buff! Estimate =	$120.00	$130.00
5655
351	USA Covers - First Flight Cover Collection. Bankers box filled with 10 binders containing 584 flight covers from the 1950's to 1980's. Each cover bears an attractive specially produced cachet to commemorate the flight. This period of flights is often overlooked by the airmail collector, with many of these flights being much harder to find than some of the earlier 1930's "classic" aviation material. Seemingly all different, this group was assembled by a single collector over multiple decades. A great chance to acquire a large original holding of this material. Estimate =	$200.00	$95.00
5655
352	USA Covers - Small box filled with 217 collector made First Day Covers from the 2000-2002 period, each with a seldom seen "modern" illustrated cachet. Along with being a group of unusual cachet FDC, the collector also made a point of visiting some obscure Post Offices within Washington and Oregon (primarily) to get these First Day Covers cancelled. A wealth of modern cancels, alongside a fair-size investment in stamps alone! A seldom seen offering, being attractive for the "modern" US collector. Estimate =	$120.00	$36.00
5531
353	USA Postcards - Dealer's stock of 314 postcards from North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Washington State.

356	Worldwide - "Party Mix" - Just like the eclectic savory snack, this lot contains an odd mix of material which somehow offers a bit of everything for the open-minded collector.

4832
358	Worldwide - A-Z collection in 3 PACKED Harris brand "standard" worldwide albums. A grand total of 39,457 stamps with everything from "classics" to "sand dunes" assembled with care by the previous owner.

374	Worldwide - Pair of 4" Uni-Safe brand 2-post albums containing Harris printed worldwide album pages with stamps from "A to G" and then "R to Z" (not sure what would have happened to the "middle album"). Even with the "missing middle", these albums contain a total of 15,919 stamps from Classics to the 1990's as accumulated over a number of years by the collector. A glance through shows there are plenty of small hidden gems to be uncovered throughout by a patient collector. Easily worth the conservative estimate. Estimate =	$200.00	$210.00

Lot includes shared designs, 7x SEPAC (small European postal administration cooperative) and Royal Weddings. Stamps and packs all appear to be in excellent condition. These packs are often overlooked at the time, as few collectors are interested in everything offered in the packs. There is also a modern trend in which anything associated with Nordic countries tends to have a high face value (and as such, these packs had a high original purchase price). As time passes, and these folders get listed in catalogues, collectors start to realize what they missed and realized how relatively few of these collections were issued. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00

6396
399	Worldwide Supplies - Small boxed filled with lightly used "Vario style" 7-row or 8-row double sided black stockpages.

Lots of life left in these, with only the occasional sticker / label or tape which can be removed. There are 155x 7-row and 10x 8-row pages, making a grand total of 165 pages.

42	Canada #27b. Inverted Watermark Variety. Used example of the 6c dark brown Large Queen on watermarked (E. & G. BOTHWELL CLUTHA MILLS) Bothwell paper, showing the entire "CL" of the watermark.

1919
45	Canada #34/53 Victorian Era Used Goldmine. Exceptional "plus value" hoard of used ½c to 10c Small Queens and (some Jubilees), all laid out for inspection on three Hagner brand stock sheets. This group unquestionably took years (or even decades) to assemble, as the vast majority of the stamps in this lot have special cancels (noted flags, precancels, Crowns fancy corks, CDS, +++), shades or papers (early through later printings, including better). Take your time viewing the scans as original intact and unpicked offerings like this are not often available. Estimate =	$750.00	$350.00

Estimate =	$325.00	$270.00
6012
48	Canada #41. Sound and F/VF CDS used block of 10 of the 3c vermilion Small Queen. An extremely rare multiple, especially one of this quality and, as importantly, used in period (1893). Note that this block is an ex-Bileski special offering from the mid-1970s and was sold for $400.00 (1970s dollars!). While Bileski waxed a bit too eloquently on some items, he knew his stuff and was "bang on" with this particular item. Worthy of any medal-worthy Small Queen exhibit. Estimate =	$500.00	$325.00

139	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 20 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2023 Unitrade =	$1,000.00	$85.00

5742
141	Canada #E1, E1a, E1b plus Cover. F/VF trio of 1898 issue 10c Special Deliveries plus a properly franked in period cover.

3827
142	Canada #E1-E4 Stamps and Covers Plus Extras. Very interesting and useful quartet of early Special Delivery covers, consisting of proper commercial usage of #E1-E4, with additional mint and used examples of most of the stamps that appear on the covers. Three of the covers are nice Canada/USA cross-border rates and destinations. Estimate =	$325.00	$130.00
6025

6012
148	Canada #MR1, MR2, MR4. F/VF mint NH trio of 1915-1916 issue GeoV Admiral design War Tax stamps. The group consists of the 1c green, 2c carmine and 2c+1c brown (die II). Each stamp fresh and sound. A good War Tax starter group. 2023 Scott Classic US$247.50 =	$334.13	$38.00

Razor sharp "DOLLARTON B.C. MR 19 '16" split-ring CDS postmarks, with "in period" usage. Partial "R" Registration marking helps to identify and justify the high value ($1.20) use of these stamps. A War Tax showpiece, conservatively valued as Fine used examples of the stamps but worth more! 2023 Unitrade =	$200.00	$240.00
3773
152	Canada #MR5. Fresh and VF mint NH example of the 1916 issue perf 12 x 8 carmine KGV 2c+1c War Tax "sheet form" coil. Unitrade is $240.00 for VF mint NH. 2023 Scott Classic US$172.50 =	$232.88	$75.00

6519
161	Canada - 2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 Post Office Quarterly Packs. Pristine lot of Quarterly Packs complete for the years 2007 / 2008 and with quarters 2/3/4 of 2006 and quarter 1 of 2009, still sealed and with all of the issues including many sought-after die cut singles as well as blocks and souvenir sheets. These are now listed in Unitrade but not yet priced, conservatively valued by the issue price on the front of the pack (which is lower than what the postage enclosed in the pack due to the increase in value of the Permanent stamps). Total face / issue price at time of production =	$158.89	$180.00
6517
162	Canada - A "Back of the Book" selection of Special Delivery & Officials stamps with 59 different used, each with a "socked-on-the-nose" CDS town cancel. Neatly mounted on hingeless album pages. A rare find, very conservatively valued by the consignor at the lowest possible Unitrade catalogue value. Total 2023 Unitrade =	$184.00	$110.00
6012
163	Canada - Bankers box of items that didn’t easily fit in other lots. Includes a 16-page stock book with lots of classics, back to QV "cents" issue and although there are many faults noted, there could be some diamonds in the ruffage. Another stock book has a nice offering of used back of the book, with airmail, special delivery and postage dues (up to about 10 of each, total catalogue value about $500.00). Another stockbook is filled with mint KGVI coils. We also noted some first day covers and souvenir cards from the 1960’s. Finally, there are loose album pages and a bag of 80s-90s kiloware with a significant number of NWT cancels! A good sort is needed. Estimate =	$140.00	$160.00
6434
164	Canada - Bankers box with collection remnants, old albums, loose pages, stockbooks and stamps in envelopes. Cobbled together from at least 10 sources, this box includes a bit of everything from QV to QEII. We even noted a small "wadge" of mint Jubilees (1/2c - 2c), but mostly seeming to be stuck together. The lot is overwhelmingly used, including a couple 20c Widow Weeds, Bluenoses, KGV-era dollar values and some "back of the book" material. Generally speaking, this is a big mix of material from 1880 - 2005-ish which will take you hours to sort. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
6490
165	Canada - Bankers box, filled with an assortment of various collections and albums. Included in the lot (in no particular order) is 1) An assortment of loose pages with a used collection back to the Map issue, with Bluenose, Parliament, Cavell, etc. 2) A stack of stockpages with used Admiral issues (previous owner had started to identify printings and plate flaws). 3) Group of 1960’s FDCs and a Canada "125" Milestone presentation pack. 4) A nice Stanley Gibbons album (with used stamps back to QV). 5) Starter collection and a stockbook of used 60’s issues. 5) Binder with several manila stockpages with used stock, noted several medium-value Quebec’s (probably the nicest grouping in the box). The balance of the box is filled odds and end of Canadian philatelic material. Estimate =	$160.00	$130.00
6490
166	Canada - Come for the cigarette tins, stay for the loose stamps. Bankers box filled with over 45 assorted (mostly) metal tins that held 50 cigarettes, from several manufacturers. Previous owner had added little knobs on several to aid with handling and opening (these tins are probably worth the estimate alone). Inside are old envelopes with used stamps, with most appearing to be early-mid 20th century off paper, but frankly we only checked a handful of the tins (so potential lurks). As there was still some space in the box, we found other loose holdings of slightly more modern Canada (up to 2008) in glassines, envelope and 102 cards (including some with BC town cancels) and stuffed the box until it was full. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
6079
167	Canada - Group of 13 Post Office issued Thematic Collections 1998-2008 for the triple "Joint Issue" packs issued with Canada, Hong Kong and China issued Lunar New Years stamps / souvenir sheets for each year. These "Thematic Collections" are listed in the back of Unitrade as collections. A few duplicates in the mix, but all are still Post Office (plastic) sealed, with no "3-hole punch" damage as we often see when collector's amalgamate these into their binders. Post Office retail at time of issue =	$163.30	$140.00
6442
168	Canada - Kiloware accumulation of mostly very modern, mostly definitives with 20 lbs of close-cut, single paper mix in a crammed full bankers box. Includes a big baggie marked "uncanceled". A wonderful opportunity for the modern specialty collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$85.00
6012
169	Canada - Modern Souvenir Sheet Mint Holding. A seemingly all-different selection of 39 "P" (permanent value) souvenir sheets, including 2022 issues (CAPEX), all neatly arranged on 10 Vario brand stockpages. A treasure trove of souvenir sheets for any "modern" collector, with many premium items and a range of interesting topical themes as Canada Post has been known to issue. Conservatively valued for the total postage value only. Total face value =	$156.40	$150.00
3820
170	Canada - Old-time red Lindner stamp album containing both Mint and Used. Fairly complete for the time period of 1939-1979 but missing the high value of the War Issue and the odd stamp here and there. The Mint stamps appear to be almost all NH although the earlier pages are the old school mounts and hard to check for hinging. Also included (in a envelope) are a few used blocks (included the $8 Grizzly pane) and a smattering of (mostly) 1990's / early 2000's complete Mint booklets (including #1972 booklet pane, the "better" hockey issue, Unitrade $90.00 alone). The Mint NH stamps / booklets alone have a face value of approximately $140.00. Conservatively valued at the useable postage value alone. Estimate =	$140.00	$150.00
5285
171	Canada - Post Office Thematic Collections. A small box filled with an array of Canada Post issued Thematic Collections plus a couple of Post Office issue "folders" as issued. The lot includes "Dinos", WWII souvenir collections, Lunar New Years (tri-issue packs), 100 Years of Toronto Maple Leafs ($5.00 fabric stamp), 50th NHL Hockey Game, Legendary Heroes, Tall Ships, Papal Visit, Locomotives etc (just to name a few). Some light duplication noted. These often-neglected Canada Post keepsakes are all listed in the back of the Unitrade catalogue, which has increased their popularity (and in turn, made them tougher to find). Very conservatively valued at the total face value of the Canadian postage (while most of these sold at a premium at time of issue) and not including FDC or dual issues from other countries included. Total face value =	$114.32	$80.00
6012
172	Canada - Recent Bonanza! All used selection of 126 different COVID period stamps including some 2023 issues, the desirable "Flying Postal Truck" issued only to postal employees and 24 different "Personal Picture Postage" (these are fast becoming the hottest Canadian philatelic collectible). Given (in our opinion) a very conservative estimate considering how tough these can be to find. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
3820
173	Canada - Souvenir Sheet Selection. A group of 26 different used souvenir sheets & panes, all being recent issues (including 2023 issues). Exceptionally hard to find used. 2023 Unitrade =	$339.00	$240.00
5285
174	Canada - Special Delivery Hoard. Selection of 129 used, sorted on stock pages. Looks like sound examples overall, but there could be the odd minor fault. All figured by the consignor at the lowest given Unitrade catalogue value, though many are better than "fine". Looks impressive overall, being a great study lot. 2023 Unitrade =	$867.00	$80.00
6255
175	Canada - U-Haul box hoard of used Canada. Primarily off-paper from the 1930's to 1990's consisting of THOUSANDS of stamps, sorted into glassines or "102" cards stuffed into small boxes plus a stockbook (filled) and some loose stockpages. While most are fairly common issues, the shear volume of the lot should provide a good sort for any accumulation collector. Estimate =	$120.00	$95.00
6041
176	Canada Cancels - Alberta Postmark Accumulation. A four-part collection consisting of...1) Selection of approximately 500 postmarks on stamp / piece mounted on pages with many SON (socked on the nose) cancels from the 1940's to early 2000's including some small towns. 2) Folder containing 4-stockpages with a total of 200 Alberta SON (socked on the nose) cancels on 1947-1953 commemorative stamp issues. 3) Group of approx. 125 Alberta MOON cancels on stamp / piece. 4) Group of 70 closed Post Office cancels, arranged on "102" cards. A nice lot for the Alberta postmark enthusiast. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
3619
177	Canada Cancels - British Columbia Postmarks. Accumulation consisting of 7 covers / postcards, all with Topping rarity factor "D" offices (Ewings Landing, Flagstone, Gething, Mount Pleasant, North Clearbrook, Remac and Scotch Creek), 80 CDS / split ring postmarks on stamp or piece (including several better offices such as Leechtown, Kettle Valley and Deer Park) and 42 MOTO postmarks on stamp or piece (neatly arranged on a two-sided stockpage). A good lot for the postmark hound. Estimate =	$120.00	$42.00
3619
178	Canada Cancels - Manitoba Postmark accumulation 2-part lot. The first part features 3 stockpages with over 130 MOON (Money Order Office Number) postmarks on stamp or piece, unchecked with many nice strikes. The second part features over 250 cancels on stamp or piece arranged on 5 Vario brand stockpages with several different varieties / styles of postmarks. A nice clean lot of postmarks from a province we don't see much material from. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
3619
179	Canada Cancels - MOON (Money Order Office Number) postmark accumulation from across Canada (primarily Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec). A neatly assembled and unchecked offering of over 220 postmarks on stamp / piece (including a couple MOTO) arranged on stockpages. An interesting unchecked offering, offered as received. Estimate =	$120.00	$65.00
3619
180	Canada Covers #L1/L10. QV postal stationery letter cards in a small box. Over 200 items, mostly mint, which includes a wide range of issues including printing, paper stock and perforation differences (with some revalued). The usual range of condition, with separated perforations or stuck (and a few are even unfolded). We haven't examined this lot in detail, but as an original hoard, this should prove rewarding for the "flyspecker". We even noticed five mint copies of L1b. These are very popular on online auctions. Estimate =	$120.00	$90.00
5979
181	Canada Covers - "The Story of Canada" First Day Covers. Very expensive collection of specially prepared deluxe First Day Covers in four volumes. This "The Story of Canada" collection consists of 84 different gold foil cacheted FDCs, all mounted on a full colour illustrated page with a story on the event being commemorated, along with a VF mint NH Canadian (or Newfoundland) stamp also associated with the event. A complete run of all the covers, uncommonly found as many of the subscribers ended the acquisition of these pricey items as the cost became excessive ($9.95 each makes for an original cost of $835.80 for this lot). One of the slipcases with a couple bumps and bruises. A great collection for the fan of Canadian history and scarce cachet types for the FDC cachet collector. Estimate =	$150.00	$180.00
6442
182	Canada Covers - 1936 "Rocket Mail" Covers. Fascinating group of six covers, all from the ill-fated TIPEX (Third International Philatelic Exhibition) 1936 cross-border "Zucker" Rocket Mail project, an extensively promoted and ultimately unsuccessful series of flights. This lot offers excellent examples of material produced during the 1930s "rocket craze". Gerhard Zucker (1908-1985), the rocket's manufacturer, was a very colourful character, as much a fraudster as a rocketeer (an interesting read online for those who are interested). Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
5281
183	Canada Covers - British Columbia "Hotel Advertising" cover selection. A tidy group of 10 covers (and one postcard) all neatly mounted and described on a collector's home-made album pages.

4858
184	Canada Covers - British Columbia "Postmarks" selection. A group of 68 collector created home-made pages featuring postmarks on stamp / piece and covers, with a wide range of "extra" information including Post Office opening / closing dates and maps showing the location of the Post Office. Take a good look through the scans to appreciate the scope of the lot. A good tidy needed, but with some potential for the keen BC postal historian / postmark hunter. Estimate =	$120.00	$32.00
4221
185	Canada Covers - British Columbia "Vancouver Locations" Postmark selection. A wonderfully mounted selection of 10 postcards and covers, all neatly arranged on collector pages with information relating the Post Office and illustrated with maps to show location.

4178
186	Canada Covers - British Columbia "Vancouver Markings" Postmark selection. A well-researched mounted group of 9 Vancouver "odd-ball" / unusual markings on covers and postcards.

A very useful group of references, with many attractive illustrations to tease the BC postal historian. Estimate =	$120.00	$44.00
6216
188	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. A powerful quintet (5) of BC Split Ring postmarks 1908-1912 on postcards. A smaller, but very sought-after offering of five "tough" BC postmarks, each of which was chosen for rarity of office (with some strikingly clear strikes in the group). Towns include Chase River 1912, Elk Creek 1910, Munro 1907, Middlesboro 1912 and Hillcrest 1908. Sure to knock a few off the list of any BC postal historian.

4178
189	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. A seldom seen offering of 7 early Victoria BC (and one Sidney) postcards, including 6 RPPC (real photo postcards) and one striking illustrated advertising postcard. The RPPC views include Beacon Hill, Oak Bay (Hotel Boats), Metropolitan Church (interior), Waterfront and the Saanich Lumber Mills (Sidney). The one printed card is a lovely 1907 "Pioneer Coffee and Spice Mills" advertising card showing four different views of the city. A high-quality offering. Estimate =	$120.00	$50.00
6266

Bill Robinson collection), Vernon 1943 MPO 1101 (Military Post Office), Victoria 1915 Sub Post Office X (WWI training grounds) and Rockford 1894 split ring postmark cover to England (although a light strike). An interesting accumulation of items, all of which are fairly tough to find. Each item is individually sleeved and priced. Total retail as marked =	$370.00	$220.00
4178
191	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. BC Mining / Kootenays accumulation from the collection of renowned BC "Kootenays" collector Peter Jacobi. A binder containing a combination of exhibit / working pages featuring Mining in BC (particularly the Kootenays) as a topic. A range of material from an 1888 Barkerville Money Order Advice form, to modern 1990's corner card covers from the "survivors" of the industry. We noted about 50 covers / postcards, several pieces / cut outs and over a dozen pieces of company correspondence (with letterheads). One of the less tangible (but invaluable) aspects of this group is the typed and written notes regarding the history of some of these companies. Estimate =	$150.00	$32.00
4858
192	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Fisherman's Cove 1939 CDS postmark on cover. A cover posted from Montreal QC on August 10th 1939 on the First Flight Airmail to Foynes, Ireland. After being carried on the flight, the cover was "returned to sender" which was the Postmaster at Fisherman's Cove BC and received a CDS postmark on the reverse of the cover dated August 31st 1939. The Fisherman’s Cove Post Office is rated as an "E" cancel in Topping and a "E1" (1-3 known examples) in Tracy Cooper’s BC post office rating update. A nice strike of one of the tougher to fine BC post office cancels, which operated as a summer office only between 1937 and 1950. Estimate =	$120.00	$55.00
4858
193	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Group of 11 different Split Ring cancels 1904-1939, all from Vancouver Islands Post Offices.

Estimate =	$150.00	$290.00
4923

4713
257	China - PRC #767/781. Nearly complete (14 of the 15, missing only #777 - $26.00 catalogue) 1964 issue Chrysanthemum set, all mint NH. A very popular and speculative topical series. The lot does include the three key 20f, 43f and 52f high values. 2024 Scott US$717.00 =	$967.95	$190.00
4713
258	Dominica #25/302. Lovely mint (with a bit of used) dealer’s stock on stock card and pages. Nice selection of the "Roseau" issues including War Tax overprints, with some potential for specialization. Includes KGVI and early QEII definitive issues, including some duplication.

Throughout there are also "back of the book" issues and some very nice cancellations. Palestine is covered with earlier issues, including some attractive mint including a smattering of overprinted Egyptian issues and some 21st century Palestinian Authority issues (with a few FDC as well). This lot is packed with potential. Estimate =	$160.00	$170.00
5474
260	Ethiopia #102/747 plus BOB. Terrific dealer’s stock of clean mint and nicely used 20th century, with only moderate amounts of duplication amongst the 1500 stamps. Noted a number of better items including #111 (4 mint, 2 used - catalogue $500.00), #139 (1 mint, 4 used - cat $155.00) and many complete sets and better values throughout. The stockbook looks great but is somehow rebuilt, with only 56 pages, some of which are upside-down! The penciled numbers do not refer to the stamps, so it leads to a bit of disorganization. Ignore these shortcomings and focus on the great stamps! Estimate =	$180.00	$170.00
2299
261	Falkland Islands /South Georgia - A nice selection of the "Falklands". The South Georgia features a nice VF Mint never hinged run up to 2000 with full definitive issues and a number of souvenir sheets scattered, with many commemorative sets that run to $15 each including the ever-popular bird/penguin topicals (the South Georgia alone catalogues US$864.00).

4741
263	France #329. PEXIP souvenir sheet issued at the 1937 Paris International Philatelic Exhibition, where it was "one per customer" for those who showed proof of admission. A very fresh example with the tiniest of a corner bend, only visible from the back. Very lightly hinged away from the stamps and catalogued as such. 2023 Scott US$360.00 =	$486.00	$80.00
269
264	France - 2002-2004 Mint never-hinged (plus a couple of used) in fresh Lighthouse brand hingeless album (with dust cover).

Good basis for further expansion, including blocks and booklet panes. Catalogued by the consignor by both Scott and Yvert catalogues. Total owner’s CV US$731.00 (Scott 2019) or 624.00 Euros (Y&T 2017). Album retail (when all these supplements where still available) was $609.50 (Lighthouse Canada). Consignor's total retail including both stamps at catalogue value and price of album converted to Canadian dollars is $1,605.00 CAD (Scott 2019) or $1,526.00 CAD (Y&T 2017).

4466
266	France - 2006-2014 Mint never-hinged souvenir sheets in a fresh Lighthouse hingeless album (with dedicated pages).

Souvenir packaging also included when available separately. We noted one of the better Salon du Timbre blocks (Y&T #99). Owner's total catalogue value 397 Euros (Y&T 2017), but the album and pages alone currently retail at $739.85 CAD (Lighthouse Canada).

4466
268	France - Two combined offering making a somewhat messy offering (in need of a good sort) of "earlies" to the 1960's arranged on two different sets of album pages within folders. A cursory look through shows a smattering of better issues, with a few hidden gems likely for the studious collector. Estimate =	$100.00	$65.00
6466
269	France and Colonies - Assorted partial collections. France includes an orange Lighthouse brand springback album with mostly used collection of commemoratives 1930-1971 and a binder with stockpages that consist of half modern France (some mint, some used) and half an assortment of colonial issues (including New Caledonia, New Hebrides, French Polynesia). The lot has an excised stockpage with about 150 mostly used French Polynesian issues and mint and used Guadeloupe with stamps to 1947, purporting to catalogue US$400.00 (year unknown) and finishes with a random assortment of pages including more Guadeloupe, Martinique, Togo, etc. About 1000 stamps, all looking very unpicked. Estimate =	$180.00	$120.00
4466
270	French Colonies - Complete sheets of Vichy-era semi-postal stamps produced in Paris, but never distributed to the colonies (World War II made this impractical). Only known mint and listed begrudgingly in Scott, these are nonetheless very attractive sheets with interesting overprints and great lathework in the margins. There are 36 different sheets in this lot, all but two of them unfolded and all are Mint never hinged. Expect a little gum aging and a bit of perf separation, but overall a very tidy group for its age. Great for display or to break up for resale. Includes issues for Indo-China, Martinique, Cameroon, New Caledonia, Equatorial Africa, Reunion, Guinee, Togo, Guiana, Wallis & Futuna, Somalia, Sudan, Inini, Ivory Coast, etc. All arranged in a Lighthouse mint sheet file. Estimate =	$160.00	$140.00
6492
271	French Colonies - Saint-Pierre & Miquelon, Mayotte, Wallis et Futuna, and New Hebrides mostly modern stamps. Eclectic lot combining issues from 4 popular French areas spanning from the early 20th century to 2002.

Some British New Hebrides issues included as well. Catalogued by the consignor by both Scott and Yvert catalogues.

Full owner’s inventory list enclosed with #s from both catalogues. Owner's total 2019 Scott US$608.80 =	$821.88	$80.00
2299
272	French Polynesia - 1960's to 1980's selection of mostly better airmails (MNH/MH) plus some common earlier material. Most of the value in better stamps witch include Scott C45-47 MNH, C57-61 MH, 206 MNH, 227 MNH and C63-67 (short MH set, no C65). Catalogued by the consignor by both Scott and Yvert catalogues. Total owner’s 2019 Scott CV US$295.35 or 2017 Y&T 352.00 Euros. Full owner’s inventory list enclosed with #s from both catalogues. Owner's 2019 Scott US$295.35 =	$398.72	$42.00
2879
273	French Southern and Antarctic Territory - Group of 11 better Mint hinged / Mint never-hinged classics plus couple of common stamps. The highlight is Scott 16-19 MNH set (Scott US$105.00) and C4, C13 MNH singles. Catalogued by the consignor by both Scott and Yvert catalogues. Owner's Scott 2019 CV US$280.55 or Y&T 2017 CV 462.55 Euros. Full owner’s inventory list enclosed with #s from both catalogues. Owner's 2019 Scott US$280.55 =	$378.74	$70.00
2712
274	German States Prussia #1/26. Mixed condition accumulation of 1850 to 1867 period issues, offered intact "as received". Expect some faults in the mix but total Scott catalogue is well over US$1,500.00! Completely unchecked for postmarks, shades or varieties. A great study group. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
3509
275	Germany #1/20, 27. Mixed condition (some faults noted) mostly used "as received" selection of 1872 issue "Large" and "Small" Shield "Imperial Eagle" issues. Completely unchecked for better postmarks or other varieties. A great study lot. Estimate =	$140.00	$85.00
5622
276	Germany - A collector's accumulation of primarily 1930's to 1950's used, with strength in the "back of the book" issues (especially Semi Postal stamps). A few hundred stamps in total, all neatly laid out on Vario brand stocksheets and identified / catalogued on the pages by the consignor. Also included (but not counted in the catalogue value) are a few pages of early DDR and some Bavaria. Owner's Scott US$1321.00 =	$1,783.35	$170.00
6008
277	Germany DDR - Complete run of 1980-1990 inclusive Mint never-hinged stamps, neatly arranged on a stockcards including souvenir sheets. A nice chance to get this run of years all at once. Estimate =	$120.00	$42.00
1315
278	Great Britain #1. Sound and Fine used example the famous 1840 issue Penny Black imperforate. Very light red Maltese Cross cancel. Position "L - I". Unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$450.00 =	$607.50	$90.00
6484
279	Great Britain #1. Used trio of 1840 issue "Penny Blacks", each one with a fault of some kind. Unchecked for plate numbers or other varieties. A good lot for the collector wanting to reconstruct a full sheet! 2024 Scott US$1,125.00 =	$1,518.75	$75.00
6443
280	Great Britain #1a. The Scott Classic and Stanley Gibbons listed intense black shade of the 1840 issue Penny Black, VF used with a sharp strike of a black Maltese Cross cancel. Unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$600.00 =	$810.00	$200.00
6108
281	Great Britain #4/653. Interesting offering of mostly used Britain in a green 64-page Lighthouse stockbook with acetate strips. A good offering of early issues, including a dozen 2d imperfs and over 100 examples of #33 for all of you "plate hunters" plus medium to higher values of QV, KGVI and QEII. The collection runs to about 1970, but there are a few more modern issues here and there and a couple of pages of regional issues. This lot is enhanced by multiples, perfins, cancels, revenues, stationery cut squares (including 4 "collars") and "locals". This is a lot with a lot of potential for the intrepid collector looking to sort these out. Estimate =	$180.00	$180.00
5719
282	Great Britain #90a. Key Queen Victoria high value, the 5/- rose from plate 4 with the "Anchor" watermark. Has a lovely "Lombard Street P.O." socked on the nose, squared circle cancel dated December 19, 1882. Well centred, nicely cancelled stamps are hard to find. Top row stamp with position "A-D". Alas this stamp has to be considered a space filler, as it has two significant creases and a couple of blunt perfs. You might be able to find another in better condition, but we doubt that it will be this attractive. 2023 Scott US$5000.00 =	$6,750.00	$230.00
6108
283	Great Britain #98-107. Generally fresh, sound and F/VF used complete set of ten 1883-1884 period issues, from the ½p up to the 1sh high value. Expect the odd small fault but still a nicer than average quality set. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,994.00 =	$2,691.90	$95.00
6525
284	Great Britain #127/148, 138a. All sound, fresh and F/VF mint OG H/HR selection of 12 different 1902-1911 period Edward VII period issues, including the two different Scott listed shades of the 1sh value. 2024 Scott US$653.25 =	$881.89	$85.00
3961
285	Great Britain #139-141. F-VF used high value trio consisting of the 2sh6p lilac, 5sh carmine rose and 10sh ultramarine 1902-1911 issue Edwards. The small internal wrinkle in the 10sh value noted for the record but all in all a very decent group. 2024 Scott US$870.00 =	$1,174.50	$32.00
4613
286	Great Britain #142. Sound and Fine centered used example of the 1902 issue £1 blue green Edward VII high value. Light but indistinct CDS postmark. Minor paper discolouration noted for the record (a light washing will help), otherwise a fault free Edwardian era top value. 2024 Scott US$825.00 =	$1,113.75	$160.00
3121
287	Great Britain #209. VF centered used example of the £1 black GeoV 1929 issue UPU Congress Commemorative. The best known of all KGV issues and missing from most collections. Light oval Registration postmarks, small marginal tears in the lower right corner noted for the record. 2024 Scott US$600.00 =	$810.00	$230.00
5560
288	Great Britain #O2/O58. A baker’s dozen Queen Victoria issues used with either "I.R Official" (Inland Revenue) or "Army Official" overprints. Many with socked on the nose CDS cancels with only minor faults noted. There is also a second copy of O4 with thicker lettering. An attractive grouping. Total 2023 Scott US$725.50 =	$979.43	$85.00
4406
289	Great Britain #O31/O38. Govt Parcels Official overprints on Queen Victoria Jubilee issue. All in typical condition, with some wrinkles, the occasional blunt perf and the usual heavy cancels. Includes two shades of the 6d and a decent forgery of the 1883 9p green issue (with over $1000.00 catalogue value, it makes for a good space filler). Total 2023 Scott catalogue US$1078.50 =	$1,455.98	$75.00
4406
290	Great Britain - Bankers box of "collection leftovers", but leftovers can be better the second time around! The box includes a big bundle of old album pages up to about 2001 (with a few seahorses and some very notable mint KEVII), binder of used Machins (including regionals, most eras), a couple of SG albums (one in nice binder with matching slipcase) and finally a Post Office binder with 70 mint PHQ cards from the late 1970’s. There are undoubtedly some missed better items here for the patient philatelist to find. Estimate =	$140.00	$200.00
6108
291	Great Britain - Bankers box of "odds and ends" miscellaneous British material, we noticed at least a dozen Seahorses, some attractive and better Victorian-era material (with cancel potential). There are nice pieces from the KGV & KGVI eras and of course lots of Elizabethan commemoratives and piles of Machins. There are albums, stockbooks, loose pages and loose stamps compiled from many different sources. Warning: This is not the lot for someone who wants to have everything in order in an hour or two! Thousands of stamps, mostly used. Definitely some duplication, but lots of fun sorting ahead for the intrepid collector. Estimate =	$160.00	$95.00
6390
292	Great Britain - Bankers box with the last of a consigned estate. Other than being British, there isn’t much of a theme here in this assortment of material. We noted a nice page of QV-KGV used with values to 5/- and a few Seahorses. There are presentation packs from the late 1960’s, some first day covers 1960’s-1990’s (some with cachet, some not), assorted loose album pages, an old springback and a couple of stockbooks with some useful material. Possibilities abound. Estimate =	$130.00	$34.00
2951
293	Great Britain - Bundle of collector packs, booklets and assorted issues (noting a number of blocks) between 1974 to the early 2000's, many still in their original US Post Office packaging (that’s not a typo) with the best being the late 1990’s-Millenium issues. A bit of duplication, but all appear to be very fine mint never hinged. Conservatively valued for the total usable postage value alone. Total face value £170.00 =	$289.00	$170.00
6128
294	Great Britain - File box with loose assortment of 300 Stanley Gibbons quadrilles pages, most with a single issue/set with a matching First Day Cover issued between 1968-2003. Includes non-post office cachets (noted a number from "Stuart"), most of which are addressed. The face value of the more recent decimal postage is over 100£ alone ($166.50 CDN), with Windsor castle issue up to 5£. Tastefully mounted, excellent condition, high formation cost and definitely some potential from the private first day cachets. Estimate =	$160.00	$85.00
6514
295	Great Britain - Modern Mostly Mint Collection. Mostly Mint NH 1970 to 2015 period collection in five 3-ring binders, all mounted on hand-drawn album pages. A bit scattered but the mint includes Prestige booklets, first and second class stamps, useable Regionals and commemorative sets. While there is also a decent quantity of used material, the lot is valued for the useable mint GB decimal postage only. The total catalogue value will be significant! Total mint face value £1,112.54 =	$1,857.88	$500.00
6108
296	Great Britain - Perfin perfection! Two stockpages with 97 used Queen Victoria stamps with perfins. Includes 4 larger format high values (#57a, 96, 108-109 - these alone catalogue over $1500.00!). The majority of these remaining items are from the Jubilee issue with at least one of each denomination. The previous owner had started to research this lot and had photocopied the back of a few of the stamps, which we have included. If there is any duplication, it is because of a perfin that appears on two different issues. Expect some condition issues as is often seen with stamps that had commercial usage. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
6025
297	Great Britain - Victoria to QEII Period Collection. Mostly used and messily mounted but still valuable 1840s to 1960s period collection of many hundreds of stamps, all on hand drawn album pages. The collection begins with a selection of perforated Penny Reds and Two Penny Blues, including a good number of plated #33s. While there are no £ values, there is a very useful quantity and variety of Victorian era material noted, decent Edwards, both Georges plus QEII singles and sets up to the end of the pre-decimal period. The total catalogue value (unchecked for varieties) will be in the thousands. Offered intact as received, certain to be useful finds. Estimate =	$450.00	$150.00
4406
298	Great Britain / Channel Islands - Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Booklets and unsorted new issues 1970’s to about 2011. Modern complete booklets in this quantity are not often seen, including in the transition to non-denominated stamps. There is a small stack of intact booklets from each Isle, most individually sleeved in plastic with catalogue numbers and prices. The total face value of these booklets is £119.00. The lot continues with two envelopes of modern mint issues, including souvenir sheets for Jersey and Guernsey. The equivalent issues for IOM are laid out on a stock sheet, along with two full page panels for William and Kate’s wedding as well as a sheet for Queen Elizabeth being Head of Commonwealth, with stamps from 27(!) countries in one page. Face value of the loose stamps £143.00. A few Alderney pieces are included but not counted. Comes with a 16-page Uni-Safe stockbook with few stamps that you can use to straighten this grouping out. Valued only at the conservative total face value of £262.00 =	$445.40	$200.00
6128
299	Greenland #10-18. The 1945 "American Issue" complete pictorial set of nine, F-VF Never-Hinged. Undervalued in Scott. A tough set to find, especially this nice. 2023 Scott US$325.00 =	$438.75	$110.00
3961
300	Greenland #179/357, B14-24a. Mint never hinged all-different selection of 136 stamps and 15 souvenir sheets from the 1990-1999 period making a complete run for that span of years. A nice way to knock off the 1990's all at once for this popular country. 2022 Scott US$577.80 =	$780.03	$80.00
2299
301	Greenland - Mint never-hinged 1938-1997 accumulation of singles, pairs and plate number blocks of four. A grand total of 746 stamps (approx. 150 different), all neatly laid out on stocksheets. Consignor's inventory list enclosed. 2023 Scott US$765.50 =	$1,033.43	$160.00
4466
302	Grenada #1/103, MR2. Mint and used selection of 50 lightly duplicated stamps, 1861 to 1929 period issues. All neatly laid out on Hagner brand stock sheets, organized, identified and valued by the consignor. Expect the odd fault. 2024 Scott US$769.35 =	$1,038.62	$220.00
3543
303	Grenada #1/599, C3-19, J1/J14. Pre-1975 Granada dealer’s stock on manilla stock sheets and 102 cards. Starts with 20 various Chalon issues and then gets a bit hit or miss, but we did note a mint set of the KGVI decimal issue and some bulkiness in the QEII issues (including Omnibus issues, souvenir sheets and topical issues). The lot touches on back of the book with the overprinted airmail set and some mint and used postage dues and some Stanley Gibbons listed only items here which are always interesting. Lastly, a draw for the postmark collector as there is some cancel potential and good value, particularly amongst the earlier issues. Estimate =	$130.00	$110.00

305	Hungary #1- 12. The first twelve stamps from the 1871-1872 period issues. The #1 and #7 are mint (#1 has little gum), the remainder are used. Examination of both the first lithographed and second engraved stamps will clearly show the differences between the two issues. Stamps are mainly sound but there are a couple of faulty stamps (the #3 having a shallow thin, the #6 also thinned). Colour varieties are featured with colour descriptions taken from Stanley Gibbons, Scott and Magyar Filatelia Vallalat catalogues. Twenty-two stamps in total. A very useful lot for the advanced collector of this popular Eastern European country. Where no colour values are shown in Scott only basic values have been used.

5724

The second binder is a 1968 Stanley Gibbons album, with a smattering of miscellaneous stamps. The binder is in amazing condition, which should see continued use as these are almost impossible to get them in decent condition anymore. Estimate =	$170.00	$110.00
3208

4827
315	Korea - Mixed offering starting with an ancient springback album that surprisingly goes up to 2011 with lots of modern mint material! The balance of the lot is a mix of album pages, dealer’s sales cards and old auction lots, that includes some better early North Korea, a few stamps of the 1951 "flags" issue with three souvenir sheets (2 cancelled FDC on the back!). To help you organize this, is a sparsely populated 32-page UniSafe stockbook. A popular collecting area, with larger lots seldom seen. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
3205
316	Latin America - U-haul box of an untamed assortment collections and dealer stock, most of which has been set aside for at least 40 years.

Overall there are few stamps issued after 1960, with the vast majority of this holding being earlier "classic" material. Hours of fun are guaranteed and we suspect there is value that is awaiting discovery! Estimate =	$300.00	$325.00
5495
317	Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia - Chaotic box with Latvia and Lithuanian issues both interwar and post-USSR material, including mint and used stamps with significant effort put into finding readable town cancels. New issues are often in original envelopes and includes some First Day Covers and postal stationery. The Estonia is light on stamps, but includes 140 interesting interim and revalued covers from the 1991-1992 period. Then there is a Minkus Russia album that is a bit lightly populated, and some loose album pages with Azerbaijan, Georgia, Levant, Ukraine, etc. that have some potential. Estimate =	$150.00	$190.00
3634
318	Liberia - 20th century hoard consisting of old auction lots, which were purchased and then ignored for years (decades).

The designs feature Nile Crocodile ($4000 value), Red River Hog ($6000 value) and the Leopard ($10,000 value). At today's exchange rate from the Liberian dollar to Canadian dollar, these sheets would represent over $8200.00 CDN face value. The Scott catalogue on these is US$430.00 per set (and you have 50 sets here). 2023 Scott US$21,500 =	$29,025.00	$290.00

The Suriname is housed in a hingeless Davo album with pages 1948 to 1984, very complete mint, mostly hinged and a page of 19th century used material that catalogued $104.00 in 2019.

4389
326	Netherlands Indies - Diverse group of different accumulations, covering 19th century issues to those which overlap the formation of Indonesia.

1319

Some mint noted but mainly used with a few Edwards in both mint and used condition. Mainly sound but with a couple of faults in the later Victorias. There are many varieties, including a few Stanley Gibbons identified not shown in Scott, most notably #65. These latter pieces are only valued as the basic stamps from Scott with no attempt to convert from pounds to dollars. There are some significantly more valuable stamps in some of the varieties. Identification has been done by the consignor, a long-time collector and student of philately. This group is nowhere near complete for varieties but is an excellent study for even the advanced collector. Owner's 2019 Scott US$2,313.65 =	$3,123.43	$260.00
6060
330	Norfolk Island - 1987-2000 Mint never-hinged collection in a "Seven Seas" illustrated hingeless album (pages to 2001). Complete for the period, plus a couple of earlier extras!

Full owner’s inventory list enclosed. Owner's total 2019 Scott US$762.00 =	$1,028.70	$120.00
2879

Three complete mint Hinged sets, consisting of the 1938, 1953 and 1963 definitive issues, plus the complete 1929 issue postage dues and a few common design types. 61 stamps in total, all F-VF.

The lot concludes with a 32-page black paged "Metro" stockbook with a couple thousand more stamps. These all add up to thousands upon thousands of stamps, in a mixed state of organization. The result of auction lots purchased and never examined. Estimate =	$150.00	$180.00
5841
334	Rhodesia #101/112. A lovely group of 11 mint Hinged 1910 "Double Heads" starting with three shades of the ½d, then ranging up to the 2sh value. All perf 14 x 14. Each stamp has been identified by the consignor using the Gibbons classification, which differentiates between shades in far more detail than Scott (with certain shades commanding more than the standard Scott value). Scott numbers are nevertheless added to the left of each stamp and the total catalogue value is provided in both Sterling (SG 2018) and USD (Scott 2021). The owner has conservatively classified for basic shades so a couple of stamps may have an additional upside value. Unchecked for plate varieties. A great start to a mint collection of this popular issue. The 2018 Stanley Gibbons catalogue value is £692.00=$1,140.00 CAD. Owner's 2021 Scott US$681.00 =	$919.35	$140.00
2879
335	Rhodesia #119/272b. Mint Hinged selection of 18 mint "Admirals" from the 1913-1923 series. This is a quality grouping, generally in Fine or better, with several stamps VF. Few faults in evidence. The owner has numbered them using Gibbons, with Die I, II and III separated by row and the perf 15 x 15 stamps clearly marked (all others are perf 14 x 14). Scott numbers are provided in the box at lower left of the stock sheet (per each stamp's position in the scan). Note that two of the stamps (SG 225 and SG 233) are not listed in Scott. Total catalogue value has therefore been done per Stanley Gibbons by the consignor. Owner's 2018 Stanley Gibbons £546.00=	$900.00	$120.00
2879
336	Rhodesia #138 Variety (SG #242). Fresh and F-VF mint Hinged example of the £1 Die II Perf 14 x 14 "Admiral" high value from the 1913-23 series.

337	Saint Lucia #807/1030 plus BOB. Dealer’s stock on 50 black stocksheets, almost all Mint and never hinged, with stamps covering the decade of 1986-1995 with very few missing. Includes up to 10 of each value with better noted such as #879 (x3), #941 (x9) and O28-39. During this time, there were many sets that catalogue about $10 each. Not just your normal offering, with an nice array of "Specimen" overprints, souvenir sheets, gutter pairs, booklets, revenues and even a couple of covers. Great topical interest, such as trains, "Royals", birds, Christmas, mushrooms, plants and butterflies. Great to build your collection or break up for online sale. Over 600 stamps in total. Estimate =	$160.00	$95.00
4466

Finally, there are a few pages that fill in some spaces with mostly common material. We noted several better items including #36/45, 130, C20, French Revolution & other common design issues. A total of 191 stamps, with minor duplication. 2023 Scott US$770.30 =	$1,039.91	$100.00
6114
339	Saint Vincent #23/897. Wide ranging dealer’s stock of over 500 stamps on manilla stock pages. A nice grouping of QV issues includes #23 (used), #39, 40, 58 (mint hinged) and the keystone issues (very lightly hinged). The chalky issue of KEVII is missing only the pound value, while there is a pound value from the "Justice" issue and the KGVI issue. Decimal era includes high values #169, #197, #239. In the 1970’s, the holding starts to include more never hinged material, as well as a number of "Specimen" overprints and the occasional souvenir sheet (many with nice topical interest, particularly fish and birds). Estimate =	$200.00	$190.00
5389
340	San Marino #1/808 plus extensive BOB. Bits of three mounted collections, with a regular issue collection of mostly mint issues (many in black mounts and never hinged - issues up to 1975). The other two collections are back of the book, one exclusively airmail and the other with semi-postals and parcel post stamps. The overall condition is excellent, but coverage is definitely hit or miss. The pot has been sweetened with a remnant of a small Italian collection from the same source. About 700 stamps in total. Estimate =	$140.00	$65.00
2951
341	Scandinavia - Smorgasbord of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Finnish material consists of a mounted collection of used 1880’s-2008, plus a 32-page stockbook with modern assortment including lots of mint semi-postals and TB (tuberculosis) labels. The Norwegian material consist of a used collection on Scott album pages 18/1209 plus BOB (owner catalogued at over $600.00 in 2005), plus year folders 1981/1987 with original Post Office price stated to be almost C$100.00. In the "other" material, there is a binder with a sparse mounted collection of Finland, Norway and Sweden, plus a couple of Faroe Islands year sets and a card with some mint modern Greenland. A number of these items used to be individual auction lots. Estimate =	$150.00	$100.00
5993
342	Sierra Leone - QV to late 1960’s basic collection plus a hoard of JFK-memorial sheets. Nice classic material with a mix of mint and used (including some nice postmarks). The sets from the mid-century are missing the top couple of values, but more modern issues are included, with a few on piece. There are two sets of the 1964 JFK self-adhesive issue in complete sheets (fascinating and lovely condition). These JFK sheets alone catalogue US$500.00. Great stock builder! Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6025
343	Straits Settlements #2/271. All used collection of 189 Straits Settlements stamps from the 1867 to 1941 period, arranged on three double-sided Vario sheets. No duplication. A few faults to be expected in the early issues; however, this is generally a quality run with most stamps F-VF and lightly cancelled. The owner has catalogued each issue with Scott numbers and values per Scott 2021. A Bangkok "B" overprint (Scott #17) is added at the end (note pulled perf). Owner's 2021 Scott US$1,239.00 =	$1,672.65	$210.00
6136
344	Sudan #1/117. A clutch of Camel-riding mailman issues, including a mint sheet file with 30 large blocks/partial sheets (over 1500 stamps) of the 1948-54 issues, including striking plate numbers (unchecked for plate/printing flaws). In addition to the large blocks / sheets, there are 15 album or stock pages with early Sudanese issues, including "back of the book" (airmail, postage due, official (both overprint and perfin)). Some cancel potential amongst the used issues. A great offering of some of the world’s favorite stamp designs. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
2299
345	Thailand #11/388. Mostly used dealer’s stock of over 2000 stamps assembled in a 32-page tan Unisafe stockbook. Very clean material, well organized, with duplication of up to 40 of a each. Lots of overprints, including a range of late 19th century issues. Includes many complete sets with individual stamps in the $5-$20 range found everywhere. Great opportunity to build a collection or to break up for online sale. Estimate =	$200.00	$65.00
2299
346	Trindad - Trinidad #2/106; Trinidad and Tobago #1/8, MR1-MR13. Mint and used collection of 107 lightly duplicated stamps, 1851 to 1953 period issues from both Trinidad and then Trinidad and Tobago.

5016
347	Turkey #8/1698 plus BOB. Three holdings combined to make one lot. Includes mounted collection on Scott Specialty pages, an old binder with ruled pages packed with mint and used stamps and a few old dealer pages, 102 and stock cards with some potentially better, like #8-13 (mint, hinged), B24, P27-28 (probably forgeries). About 1000 stamps, mostly unchecked by us. Estimate =	$150.00	$120.00
6255
348	Turks / Turks and Caicos #1/57, 1/722. Plymouth album with starting with the classic "Turks" issues, in usual mixed condition but with a catalogue value of over $600.00, not including some of the dubious overprints (or in the case of #6, formerly overprinted) stamps. When this Caribbean colony joined up with Caicos in 1900, only the occasional stamp or set was issued. The Turks and Caicos portion of this lot has a nice showing of (primarily) used examples of most issues up to the 1980’s, including a smattering from the first issue through the KGVI "Salt" issue and including the 1935 and 1948 Royal Wedding common design issues. There are some nice apparently postally used examples from most of the QEII definitive issues, plus a good run of commemoratives (catalogue value of $397.15). Tucked into the back of the album is a small folder with about a dozen used souvenir sheets, plus some other issues that the collector never got around to mounting, not counted in the catalogue value. Total 2022 Scott catalogue value US$997.15 =	$1,346.15	$180.00
3543
349	Turks and Caicos Islands #25/1496. Three mint collection segments which mesh together nicely. The first is a loose envelope of dealer cards with bits and pieces that the collector never got around to mounting (including a nice, never hinged set #121-135). This is followed by a few loose Scott Specialized pages covering 1976-1980 and a few computer generated pages 1981-85. Then there are more computer generated pages with nearly complete run of issues 2003-2008 (these were catalogued at $385.00 some years ago, which appears to be a touch low by the 2023 catalogue). A few hundred stamps and lots of souvenir sheets. All the stamps on pages are in mounts and appear to be never hinged. Estimate =	$160.00	$90.00
3961
350	United Nations - UNICEF Flag issue presentation panels, first day covers collection. A visually striking group of 8.5x11 panels referred to as "Proof Editions" depicting a piece of art associated with the country being honoured, plus a single stamp cancelled on the first day of issue. There are 45 plain and 5 "deluxe" folders, with each having two countries represented. There is some minor duplication, but with these panels is a bundle of the matching first day covers with the same cachet depicted on the panel. Included with the lot are a few 1970’s (New York) year sets, which appear to have their glassine of matching stamps. Significant original cost. Estimate =	$140.00	$30.00
6514
351	United States / Canal Zone #4/159. A nice collection of Mint and Used, including lots of overprints on US and Panama issues mounted on 2-post Scott pages with lots of better items throughout. Includes a good smattering of "back of the book", with the highlight being the 17mm airmail official overprints CO10, and CO12 (cat $330.00). Fresh and fairly complete from 1930-1960. Includes a few modern postal stationery items are not counted in the owner’s (accurate) 2023 catalogue value. Total 2023 Scott US$1186.45 =	$1,601.71	$350.00
4261
352	United States Territories - Dealer’s stock of Hawaii (23 mint stamps, including "Provisional Government" overprints, usual mixed condition - 2015 Scott cat $253.00), Danish West Indies (which became the US Virgin Islands) group of 20 mostly used stamps (significantly damaged not counted - 2019 Scott $260.50) and six manila stock pages with mostly used stock, catalogued $173.00 in 1992(!), but a random sample indicates that the prices are almost identical in 2023. A great way to expand your US collection. Total Scott catalogue US$686.50 =	$926.78	$70.00
4261
353	USA #11A/116. A selection of 17 early used issues. Identified and conservatively catalogued by owner as basic Scott numbers. Depending on shades, some stamps may have an upside value. Small faults on several of the stamps noted while others are relatively fault-free. Carefully review the images of the lot to determine accuracy and overall quality. A useful grouping with many stamps that present well and would be a sound addition to any collection. Owner's 2021 Scott US$1,794.00 =	$2,421.90	$180.00
5742
354	USA #20/217. A pretty used group of 39 stamps from 1870 to 1888 period, neatly arranged on two Hagner brand stock sheets. Used, generally lightly cancelled, with a couple of MNG noted. The stamps run between Scott #20 and #217. Each stamp is identified by year, number and corresponding value by the consignor from the 2021 Scott Catalogue. A few small faults are to be expected, but condition is mostly above average for this period. Where faulty, items are identified as not counted towards catalogue value. No duplication, though there are a few shade variations included. We note a nice #209b (catalogue US$375.00). A great basis for expansion for this period of US philately. Owner's 2021 Scott US$1470.00 =	$1,984.50	$160.00
1315
355	USA - An "Odds AND Sods" accumulation in a carton. Included are three albums... 1) Minuteman album with mint stamps 1927-1964 and a smattering of mint panes including "Century" series and "Star Wars" with some decent looking airmails (most in black mounts). Total face value in album one amounts to roughly US$62.00 ($83.40 CDN). 2) Minuteman album with pages to 1984, includes $5 Hamilton, Norse issue, both NH with a small amount of "Back of the Book" issues. Face value in album two amounts to roughly US$60.00 ($80.75 CDN). 3) Scott Liberty album with 1984-1997 pages with a smattering of mint and some FDC’s. Face value in album three amounts to roughly US$75.00 ($100.90 CDN). There are also a couple of mint sheet files with large blocks up to panes from 1946-1977 and a manila envelope filled with photo pages with blocks and part sheets slipped in. Last, but not least, is a group of pages knifed out of a stockbook with some promising stamps back to the 1920’s. There are better bits and pieces throughout and a total face value of the stamps conservatively counted at US$225.00. Estimate =	$250.00	$110.00
5115
356	USA - Bankers box filled with albums, album pages and loose stamps (including Back of the Book and Cinderella stamps). Noted some stockpages, Fleetwood FDCs and INPEX show cards from the mid-70s. Overwhelmingly used material, comes from parts of a dozen collections, so there are different sources and collecting emphasis. Guaranteed hours of exploration ahead for the buyer! Estimate =	$120.00	$24.00
5575
357	USA - Collector's accumulation of Mint and Used stamps, compiled on stockcards within a 16-page Unisafe brand stockbook. Noted some better items such as Prexie issue coils. A nice clean lot. Estimate =	$100.00	$36.00
4034
358	USA - Postal stationery envelope hoard, mostly circular die 1915-1950’s, all appear to be used. Unchecked by us, but we did notice differences in denomination, paper colour and dies, with many different windows and Post Office printed corner cards. Obviously from a wide range of sources, this is a very diverse lot. There is a handful of covers as well, most from the same vintage, including some WWII censor covers used to Canada. At least 1500 items. This was a labour of love, evidenced by the handwritten scrawl on the box that reads "I’m keeping these"! Huge research opportunity. Estimate =	$140.00	$22.00
3208
359	USA Hawaii #UX1/UX9, UY2. Uncommon grouping of 16 mint postal stationery cards on 2 pocket Scott album pages. Includes different printings, "Provisional Government" overprints and the 2c reply card (separated, as was often how they were collected - and reflected in Scott). There are six duplicate cards, each of which has a small, near identical punch hole in the lower right quadrant (not sure if this indicates that they came from an archive). Cards have usual bit of aging, but overall are in decent condition. Print quantities for these cards ran 5,000 - 125,000, so these have never been available in large quantities. Total 2022 Scott Specialized catalogue value US$747.50 =	$1,009.13	$85.00
6232
360	Vietnam and Indochina - Dealer’s stock, accumulation and mounted collection. Chronologically, there are a few pages of Indo-China along with dealer’s auction sheets from the late ‘60s with wholesale levels of mint (folded) blocks and even sheets of various commemorative issues. The greatest catalogue value is in a couple of bundles of glassine envelopes, with Vietnam #20-26 with about 80 mint never hinged sets (brown gum) (cat $25.00 a set - total US$2000.00). There is mounted collection of 1951-1975 (Kingdom and South) Vietnam on Scott album pages (stated to catalogue $200.00), followed by a 32-page stock book with North Vietnam issues and a few FDC circa 1991. Also included is a small mounted collection of 1950’s mint and used Cambodia with a couple hundred dollars of catalogue value. Estimate =	$250.00	$160.00
1319
361	Wallis and Futuna - 1957-2004 Mint never-hinged / hinged on Lindner pages (dedicated pages run for 1980-1990). Roughly 60-70% never-hinged, with plenty of lovely better stamps and including many complete sets. Catalogued by the consignor in both Scott and Yvert catalogues. Total consignors catalogue value US$1,001.00 (Scott 2019) or 1,246 Euros (Y&T 2017). The pages would have a decent retail value too if bought new. Full owner’s inventory list enclosed with #s from both catalogues. Owner's 2019 Scott US$1001.00 =	$1,351.25	$160.00
4389
362	West New Guinea - UNTEA overprints - Second Printing (Haarlem) #1a-19a. VF mint NH complete set, in corner blocks of four of the 1962 UNTEA overprints on the stamps of Netherlands New Guinea, second printing (Haarlem). This printing can be distinguished by the top of the "N" being slightly higher than the "U" and the concave base of the "T". A very short-lived provisional series, produced by the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian administration. Increasingly elusive provisional issues, all properly identified as the second printing. 2023 Scott US Specialized US$204.40=	$275.94	$38.00
6484
363	West New Guinea - UNTEA Overprints #1c, 5c. Fourth printing of the 1963 UNTEA overprints on the stamps of Netherlands New Guinea, local West New Guinea printing. This fourth overprinting measures 19mm wide (only two values with this overprint, #1c and #5c, the 1c and 10c values). Very short-lived provisionals, produced by the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian administration. These two stamps are the scarcest of the UNTEA overprints. 2023 Scott US Specialized US$200.00 =	$270.00	$55.00
5577
364	Worldwide - Princess Diana themed First Day Covers (FDC) in 14 Stanley Gibbons "Royal Events" cover albums. Includes 160 covers for the 1982 "Royal Baby" (Prince William), most of which are the stamps issued for Diana’s 21st birthday (but overprinted). There are also 216 covers for the 1981 Royal Wedding between Charles and Diana, almost all are the "common design" issues, including a number with souvenir sheets. The covers are all cacheted, unaddressed and a number are signed by the designer. There appears to have been confusion with this collector’s standing order, as there are duplicates throughout, with the "Royal Baby" issue having up to 4 of one type and the "Royal Wedding" with up to 6 of one type. The original cost of these covers was 2-7£ EACH! The albums are well loved, and the covers probably need to be rehoused. A total of 376 covers, representing an astronomical original cost. Great for on-line sales. Conservatively estimated at less than 50c per cover! Estimate =	$170.00	$85.00
6514
365	Worldwide - A British Commonwealth mix of material including a Great Britian "SAFE" dual album with stamps / pages to 1951, Great Britain stock of GeoV material on stockpages removed from a stockbook, Commonwealth post-GeoVI sets and singles on black vinyl stockpages, a 16-page stockbook with a nice range of commonwealth issues, and old Victorian era stockbook made from a old-time school book and a while envelope of Ireland and British Pacific. In need of a good sort, this should prove rewarding to the patient collector. Estimate =	$140.00	$180.00
6353
366	Worldwide - About 17 lbs of "on and off" paper kiloware, mostly modern, with no Canadian material. Quite a treasure trove for the collector, with many thousands of stamps to sort! Unsorted in baggies stuffed into a banker's box as received. Estimate =	$130.00	$85.00

2951
368	Worldwide - Bankers box containing loose stamps, bundles, an old Moir’s chocolate boxes, dealer glassines and packets. Lots of Canada, but there is also a fair amount of material from around the globe, as this is the amalgamation of several old-timey holdings. Lots of the stamps are off paper, so some of the soaking is already done! Thousands of items here, completely unchecked by anyone. A sorters paradise. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
3969
369	Worldwide - Bankers box jammed full with "on and off" paper from most eras, which includes everything leftover from worldwide collector’s consignment. Consisting of many items set aside "to be dealt with later", which were all tossed in the box and is now yours to explore. While there is some Canada and USA, there is also material from the across the seven seas scattered here and there. Almost all used and totally unchecked, with some potentially interesting cancels. Of particular note is the diversity of the lot, as each handful brings new surprises (and there are many handfuls to be had). Very few envelopes or packages, this is just a pure stamp extravaganza. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
3969
370	Worldwide - Bankers box, nearly filled with loose stamps, with all appearing to be OFF-PAPER, including significant representation from the first half of the 20th century. There are potential better values everywhere. Should be 99% used, with almost no filler from envelopes or glassines. We have kept this box as received, as it won’t get any better than this. Estimate =	$180.00	$180.00
3969
371	Worldwide - Dealer's stock "Aden to Finland "consisting of a few hundred "102" cards filled with both Mint and Used sets, partial sets and singles. While most of these cards have a catalogue value of under $5.00, there are still a fair amount of better items throughout. A nice clean lot, accurately identified and catalogued by the consignor (inventory sheet included). See subsequent lots for more from this offering. Owner's total 2017 Scott US$1570.05 =	$2,119.57	$260.00
6466
372	Worldwide - Dealer's stock "France to Luxembourg "consisting of a few hundred "102" cards filled with both Mint and Used sets, partial sets and singles.

Owner's total 2017 Scott US$1432.95 =	$1,934.48	$150.00
6466
374	Worldwide - Desk, Shelf and Floor Lot. Densely packed carton containing an astoundingly wide range of material, semi-sorted and unsorted, from a messy stamp estate that was scattered throughout a number of "working areas" in the house. The lot consists of Canada, Provinces and British Commonwealth as well as general foreign material, housed in stock books, on album pages, on stock cards and loose. The eclectic nature of this lot is due to the disparate sources that went in it and is a prime candidate for profitable "mining". Estimate =	$400.00	$260.00
4034
375	Worldwide - Eclectic Red Box and Stock Book Melange. Carton load of worldwide material consisting of several thousand well organized collector's extras.

These three albums are clean and sparsely populated, representing a great opportunity for the classic philatelist wanting to collect only older material. Loads of material to play with and even the loose stamps will contain pleasant surprises. Estimate =	$500.00	$260.00
5882
380	Worldwide - Offering of 10 different countries, featuring several hundred stamps in glassines (sorted by country) and catalogued.

5241
383	Worldwide - Small box containing a couple hundred stockcards with a wide array of both Mint and Used stamps, with several better items noted throughout.

5241
384	Worldwide - Small box of "odds and ends" offered as received. We noted a nice run of African nations including some "presentation or proof" material, full sheets of Vatican, Haitian overprints, Hungarian occupation stamps, Fiume study lot, Cuban revenues, a few stockbooks of miscellany, dozens of loose glassines and some interesting primarily USA "signed" stamps (featuring autographed stamps by "famous" people). Well worth the estimated value. Estimate =	$200.00	$95.00
4034
385	Worldwide - Ten mint sheet files or folders containing a wide range of sheets, part sheets and a few larger presentation sets or souvenir sheets. While there is a little bit from everywhere, we noted sheets from Hungary (many), Croatia, Romania, Grenada, Italian East Africa, Bolivia, St. Vincent, Mexico, Mozambique, Ghana and Germany. Probably 300 items, most from the WWII era to 1980's with a couple heavily duplicated. Overall condition is great, as we didn’t see much curling or perf separation and no adhesion between sheets.

4466
387	Worldwide - Trio of philatelic concoctions - which can be yours at a fraction of the original cost. Lot consist of 1) Large binder from the Postal Commemorative Society with about 75 visually pleasing large panels. Each one with a topical theme and set of stamps from one country to match this theme (all circa 1980).

Limited to 35,000 sets worldwide from the Excelsior Collectors Guild. We believe this series set the original purchaser back about US$400.00. Your way to get some flashy material to spice up your collection, at a fraction of the original cost. Estimate =	$140.00	$85.00
6514
388	Worldwide - Two Uhaul boxes, with collections, albums, scraps and loose stamps . A couple of the albums are older, with more classic material (complete with the usual range of condition but with some more classic issues as an upside). There are some Harris albums including a Citation (the "holy-grail" of Worldwide albums at a time) and a random assortment of computer-generated pages from Western European countries and their colonies. While the computer generated pages are a bit lightly populated, they are perfect for expansion. Thousands upon thousands of stamps. A picker’s delight. Estimated value =	$200.00	$150.00
6478
389	Worldwide - Uhaul box of old-time collections, stock books, album pages and anything else that didn’t quite make a lot on its own, becoming a balance of a consignment. There are 15 volumes here, plus loose material. There are a couple of very old worldwide collections packed into disintegrating albums. Unchecked in detail, but did notice a used Bluenose which leads to hope that there are other items lurking. Most of the items have no real rhyme or reason to them but did note some Germany and Western Europe (including their colonies). Not much Commonwealth, US, Asia or South America. Guaranteed hours of exploration here. Estimate =	$160.00	$190.00
5719
390	Worldwide - Uhaul box packed "onion" style with on and off paper from most eras, and all corners of the world. "Onion" referring to the box being layered, not that it will bring tears to your eyes. Not interested in what you are seeing, dig down another centimeter and there will be something completely different. The remnant of an estate, where everything that had nowhere else to go, or was planned on being soaked just got put in the box. While there is some Canada and United States, there are also stamps from at least 50 different countries. Includes the occasional dealer pack and there are a few glassines here and there, but generally speaking, this will be a winter’s worth of hunting. Estimate =	$140.00	$85.00
6486
391	Worldwide - U-Haul box stuffed with on and off paper randomness, from a few different holdings. Includes a fair amount of worldwide stock sorted in envelope by country. There are small glassine envelopes throughout with odds and ends of all sorts. We noted some more recent Machins, some late 20th century South Africa, but for the most part it is bits from all corners of the earth. Calling all sorters and soakers! Estimate =	$100.00	$65.00
6512
392	Worldwide Cinderellas - A magnificent holding with strength in USA. We noted a number of different Exhibition labels (including for Industrial or Electrical Fairs) and "Devil Dog / US Marine" in quantities up to 100 of a kind. There are WWII-era labels or poster stamps from many different countries, revenues, tourism, Philatelic Exhibitions, Coronations as well as the usual mix of TB/Christmas seals (lots of Canada, including complete sheets. There is some ephemera, such as stickers / baggage labels for Habitat and Ethiopian Airlines. This collection took decades to assemble. Take a good look at the photographs to truly appreciate the value and scope of the lot. Cinderellas have arrived at the ball! Conservatively estimated in our opinion. Estimate =	$300.00	$325.00
4064
393	Worldwide Covers - Small box filled with a few hundred Worldwide covers, featuring a nice array of both countries represented with both commercial and philatelic mail. Noted a nice run of Chinese domestically sent covers, some British cachet FDC, USA first flights, earlier USA commercial mail, 1937 Coronation FDC, USA / Canada FDC and a pair of 1870's French Trans-Atlantic covers to USA. A good sort for any postal historian. Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00
5190

Included MANY better items such as patriotics, portraits, military uniformed, souvenir of coronation (1911), "God Save the King" song postcards, real photo (RPPC) postcards and "The King at the Front" postcard featuring his trips to the front-lines to visit the soldiers during WWI. A total of 67 postcards, perfect for the collector or show / internet dealer as many of these would retail for $20-$30 each. Estimate =	$160.00	$290.00
6150
395	Worldwide Postcards - Bermuda Postcard Collection 1906-1980. A Unisafe brand postcard album (with sleeve, retail $40 alone) housing 40 different views of Bermuda. The strength of the collection is in the earlier views, with 16 of cards being postally used. A nice glimpse into this British Overseas Territory. Estimate =	$120.00	$85.00
6216
396	Worldwide Postcards - Stunning "Calendar", "Clocks" and New Years Greeting Postcard Collection. A collector's accumulation of 283 postcards, neatly arranged within a large postcard album, with all cards appearing to be from the "classic" pre-1920 postcard period (with a good showing of pre-1910 early postcards). Arranged to showcase a couple of interesting topicals being illustrated Calendars and Clocks. Take a good look at the images to appreciate the value of this lot, assembled over the course of many years by the previous collector. Estimate =	$220.00	$325.00
3634
397	Worldwide Supplies - 2022 Scott Catalogues. Complete set of 2022 Scott International stamp catalogues, all in very clean "nearly new" There have been no major price changes between the 2022 and 2024 catalogues. As such, this set is still extremely useful for valuing most material and the numbers don't really change. New, these 12 volumes would retail for well over $1,200.00. The Scott catalogue numbering system is the most universally recognized stamp numbering system used today. Estimate =	$350.00	$425.00
3902
398	Worldwide Supplies - Group of Lighthouse brand supplies including 3 albums (used blue, unused brown and lightly used red, the latter filled with 2-line Lighthouse pages). This is followed by 6 packs of unused blank pages, plus a bundle on additional unused blank pages from opened packs. Take a look at the prices online for these supplies "as new" to appreciate the value in this lot! Estimate =	$150.00	$260.00
6108
399	Worldwide Supplies - Small boxed filled with lightly used "Vario style" 5-row, 6-row, 7-row and 8-row double sided black stockpages. We say "Vario style" as these seem to be a mix of Vario...but also Unitrade and other unmarked pages, all intended to be the same style as Vario. Lots of life left in these, with the occasional sticker / label or tape which can be removed. There are 17x 8-row, 55x 7-row, 50x 6-row and 35x 5-row pages, making a grand total of 157 pages. These would easily retail "as new" for over $200.00 with the ever-rising cost of philatelic supplies. Estimate =	$130.00	$150.00
3902
400	Yugoslavia and Forerunners - A lot representative of the region’s history: somewhat fractured and disorganized at times, while promising at others. The best section is Italian Occupation of Ljubljana (Laibach) consisting of 34 Mint hinged stamps, with semi-postals (catalogue US$300.00). There is a Scott Specialized Serbian selection, along with bits and pieces of Croatia (including a 16-page stockbook) and Bosnia & Herzegovina. Finally, the lot concludes with a Zagreb stockbook with a nice 1930’s-1960’s selection, a 16-page stockbook of assorted material and a used collection up to 1990 of Jugoslavia on ruled pages (with some back of the book). Potential lurks throughout for the patient sorter. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00

All fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Hinged (mostly Very Fine and Lightly Hinged) collection of 124 different 1937 to 1965 period issues, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. Consists of a range of all complete sets for the GeoVI and QEII era. As well as Aden proper (#13/74), the lot consists of Seiyun (#1/41), Mukalla (#1/52) and Federated South Arabia (#1-26). Total 2024 Scott US$364.30 =	$491.81	$100.00
3552
2	Antigua #43/212. All fresh and Fine to Very Fine all mint Hinged (mostly Very Fine and Lightly Hinged) collection of 124 different 1921 and then 1937 to 1968 period issues, all complete sets from 1937 up and all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. 2024 Scott US$253.20 =	$341.82	$70.00
5241
3	Antigua #106/693. Elizabethan issues up to 1983, quite complete with 28 souvenir sheets. About half of the stamps are never hinged in black mounts, and most of the souvenir sheets are never hinged. All on Minkus album pages, with bit of "and Barbuda" at the end. Good range of issues, many sets and lots of topical interest. Owner’s 2023 Scott US$470.45 =	$641.85	$70.00
2951
4	Antigua / Barbuda - Group of mostly Elizabethan issues, up to 2000 including lots of complete sets, souvenir sheets and overprints on Antiguan issues for sale in Barbuda. Lots of topical interest, including airplanes, birds, "stamp on stamp" etc. Most of the more recent will be mint, never hinged and all appear to be in excellent condition (except 20,000 Leagues sheetlet). The "new issue" pricing on these issues gave collectors pause, which is why there is now a scramble to fill in collections from these missing years. Estimate =	$140.00	$110.00
4466
5	Ascension #1/124. All fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint, mostly Very Lightly Hinged 1921 to 1969 period collection of 102 different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on three Hagner brand stock sheets.

6372
6	Australia #1/378. Can dealer’s stocks ever be considered "fun"? We think that this one meets the test. Starts with lots of used ‘Roos and GeoV "Heads", which a quick check of some of the better indicates that they are accurately identified with cancel potential everywhere and unchecked for print varieties. This is followed by a number of mint 1930’s issues with value, including 3x pound-value "Robes" and 2x £2 "Arms" and a £1 Explorer. There are several mint and used blocks which include some imprint blocks. The binder evolves into a used collection of the same era (lots of nice SON cancels) with a bit of "States" material. Finally, there are three collection fragments from 1930 to 2000, with everything from a mint pound "Arms" to modern used commemoratives. Not your usual grab bag from down-under. Estimate =	$240.00	$210.00
4466
7	Australia #57, 101, 127, 128. Quartet of high value "Roos" overprinted "Specimen" from three different sets. Nice fresh appearances, but three of four have hinge remnants. Great to fill the space until the real one comes along! Pro-rata from 2018 Stanley Gibbons (where these are listed) £560.00 =	$924.00	$230.00
4683

Complete sets for the GeoV and QEII period and a complete run from 1937 up to 1968. 2024 Scott US$688.80 =	$929.88	$130.00
5016

All Very Fine mint and almost all Never Hinged (any Hinged stamps have been turned upside down) duplicated selection of 1931 to 1951 GeoV and GeoVI period issues, including multiples. Note a wide range of shades and papers, listed as varieties in both Scott Classic and Stanley Gibbons catalogues. The lot includes the two 1931 issue 2sh and 3sh "Seal of Bahamas" high values, 1938 to 1951 issue ½p to £1 GeoVI definitives and the 1942 Columbus overprints. Conservatively valued as either the basic types or the more commonly found shade/paper varieties. Could easily be upside for types better than the ones that have been valued here by Scott. Stanley Gibbons will certainly be higher. 2023 Scott Classic US$473.30 =	$639.23	$210.00
4506
10	Barbados #193/311. All Fine to Very Fine almost all mint (#216-227 are used) Very Lightly Hinged 1937 to 1968 period collection of 118 almost all different stamps, all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stocksheets.

6008
16	Bermuda #118/142. Almost all VF mint Hinged 1938 to 1953 GeoVI (plus the QEII Coronation commemorative) period issues, 34 stamps in total, all still mounted on the original printed and quadrille album pages. Of particular note (and value) in this lot are various shades and perfs of the GeoVI high value "key plates". A superior quality offering. 2024 Scott US$647.25 =	$873.79	$130.00
6136
17	Bermuda #123/128. Mint and used selection of 20 GeoVI era "Key plates", all laid out on one Hagner stock sheet. Includes perf 13 and perf 14 type, as well as shades. The consignor has valued all the stamps as the most basic Scott types. 2024 Scott US$410.25=	$553.84	$85.00

18	Bermuda #123/128 High Value Key Plates. All VF mint NH selection of 10 high value 1938 to 1951 period GeoVI key plates, all different for denomination or perf.

6175
19	British Africa - Catch-all of old auctions lots, that were purchased, but never processed by the collector. Ranging from QV "classics" to 1990’s issues, there are several hundred mint and used stamps with singles and sets alike. We noted some Gold Coast has some cancel potential, a selection of Somaliland items that have nice eye appeal and a group of 202 mint (mostly NH) stamps from Namibia. There are also a few album pages with mint Nyasaland/Malawi, a nice selection of used Zimbabwe, #81/94 from Southern Rhodesia (cat $98.00; mint,hinged) and a touch of Sierra Leone to round out the lot. Estimate =	$160.00	$70.00
6466

Fresh appearance, but almost all have heavy hinging and damage from adhesion (likely from original presentation booklet or archive). Still an eye-catching addition for your collection. Total 2018 Stanley Gibbons (pro-rata) £189.50 =	$303.20	$46.00
6175
21	British Carribean - Assortment of British Colonies from a wide range of sources, with strength in the Elizabethan era. The best is likely a binder of mint St.Vincent (1970-1982) and a page of classic Virgin Islands, followed up with two "Official" overprinted flower sets (never hinged). There is a battered 3-pocket stockbook filled with 1970’s to 1982 mint Barbados and a better stockbook with used Barbados. There are also loose album and stock pages with Granada, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, British Guiana/Guyana, Jamaica and St. Lucia. The lot ends with a Minkus British America album that has seen better days, but might have the odd better item here or there. Estimate =	$150.00	$75.00
3961
22	British Commonwealth - Australia & Pacific Island focused box lot, with albums, presentation packs and a year set. Noted a bundle of Fiji, Niue, Tokelau and a sleeve of large blocks of Papua New Guinea used postage dues. Some nice cancels on the Australian States material. There is some British Africa, Ireland, and a smattering from many corners of the Empire. Didn’t notice much Canada, Great Britain or New Zealand, but thousands of stamps here that will take some time to explore. Estimate =	$150.00	$110.00
5991
23	British Commonwealth - Banker’s box accumulation. This lot starts with UK on pages, including a couple dozen #33 and a swath of attractive QV issues.

A bit disorganized, but that’s where the fun starts! Thousands of mint and used stamps here. Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6511
24	British Commonwealth - Bankers box of assorted bits of albums, stockbooks, approval sheets and old auction lots (purchased and then ignored). Some of the individual countries include Leeward Islands, Jamaica, Montserrat, Turks and Caicos, Norfolk and Papua New Guinea. There are a few volumes that have assorted stamps from across the Empire, some mint, some used. Didn’t see many complete sets but most of the material is pre-1975. These individual items cost the original collector several hundred dollars. Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
6511
25	British Commonwealth - Random representation of the Empire in a bankers box. Lot includes albums, stockbooks, old auction lots, loose pages and loose stamps. While there are a couple of individual country albums (Cook Islands early 70s, Ghana, Malaya & States), the majority of the lot is a random assortment of miscellaneous bits and pieces. A quick flip shows there to be potential at every turn, including cancels and just overlooked better stamps. Thousands of stamps in total, a perfect way to cheaply add to your collection and make some friends with the items you don’t need. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00

Mini-hoard of 26 complete KGVI booklets (most War Issue, but some Mufti and couple later), with generally sharp corners, no penciled notes and minimal oxidation of the staples.

Sharp corners, no writing and minimal staple oxidation. Unpriced in Unitrade with the note: "an example has been reported to the editors". Based on the source, we don’t believe that this is the reported example and is likely the second reported copy. A must-have for any GeoVI / War Issue or booklet collector. Estimate =	$400.00	$210.00

5869
145	Canada #F1iii. VF used example of the 2c Registration stamp with the Unitrade listed "burr at UR corner (Pl. 1 pos. 38)" constant plate flaw. The flaw is well clear of the light postmark. Much harder to find than the catalogue price would suggest. 2023 Unitrade =	$150.00	$46.00
5869
146	Canada #F3. Sound and Fine mint regummed example of the 1876 issue 8c dull blue Registration stamp. 2024 Scott US$675.00 =	$911.25	$160.00

A few hundred stamps in total, unchecked for horizontal or vertical ribbing on the QEII Wilding issues and a good study of the different "G" positions (although none extreme).

Want to display the insides of your booklets without resorting to "exploding" perfectly good (and expensive) booklets? This lot has a couple hundred booklets that only appear to be missing the stamps, meaning you can open these up and show what is inside (and still feel guilt free). The group starts with the "Admiral" period, with an astonishing number of booklet types, with different covers (including overprints, and languages), followed by more GeoV (e.g. Arch issue), lots of KGVI booklets (a number of "chewing gum" covers) and some QEII up to the Centennial era. There is definitely duplication, with some partially exploded already. We aren’t sure how these came to be accumulated, but we know that it is a rare chance to acquire this research and display opportunity. Estimate =	$140.00	$150.00
5803

We noted a pair of the 20c Quebec used on piece and some decent "back of the book" material. Expect to have to do some digging to sort it out. The bulk of the lot is several binders with KGVI to 1900’s used material on manila and black stock pages. There is probably some overlooked material here and always potential for postmark seekers. Estimate =	$140.00	$80.00
6301

Most come from the remnants of estates and this material has received a cursory look over, revealing there is potential everywhere. There is also some added value in the supplies that should be considered (stockbooks, stockpages etc). A good way to spend a few darker, fall evenings. Estimate =	$120.00	$75.00
6301
170	Canada - Mint Early QEII Collection in Lighthouse Hingeless Album. VF condition "top of the line" Lighthouse SF (Hingeless) album with matching slipcase, pages from 1851 up to 1986, containing a very comprehensive QEII period mint NH collection of regular issues (no â€œback of the bookâ€). Noted dollar values, Winnipeg tags and much more, including numerous better sets and singles. The retail price of the SF Canada album and slipcase is $470.00 and the total useable face value of the stamps in the album is $173.00. Excellent basis for expansion or for the Canadian collector only interested in the earlier material. Estimate =	$325.00	$220.00
5868
171	Canada - Modern Mint in Lindner Album. "Nearly new" top-of -the line single volume burgundy Lindner album containing high quality Hingeless Canada pages running from 1983 up to 1993 (Lindner pages #84-139).

Total face value =	$208.11	$150.00
5285
172	Canada - Modernish Mint Collection in Album. Slightly messily mounted almost all mint collection of 1972 to 1986 period stamps and souvenir sheets, all housed on printed album pages with clear plastic page protectors. The lot often includes both singles and blocks of the same stamp. Noted face values from 1c up to $5.00. The entire collection is conservatively valued for the useable face value of the mint postage only. Total face value =	$462.41	$375.00
5285
173	Canada - Mostly used collections including a collector’s duplicates and stock hoard, all lovingly (but tightly) packed into a bankers box. While there is a bit of Victorian era material, most is 20th century including some back of the book. Unchecked for cancels, but a cursory look revealed some better single stamps here and there. Don’t overlook the value in a couple of nice stock books and the manila and Vario-brand pages found throughout. A good sort ahead for the Canadian stamp hound. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
6041
174	Canada - The 1999/2000 Millennium Collection (Unitrade catalogue Thematic Collection #89). VF condition carton load of 61 examples of the popular "sleeper" Official Millennium Keepsake Collection issued by Canada Post for the 1999/2000 Millennium. The flat tin, embossed with a dove in flight, contains a trio of single stamp panes #1812i, 1813i and 1814i (46c, 55c and 95c values) which were only available in the tin, a pre-paid worldwide post card and a quarter-sized token. Overlooked by most collectors who bought the heavily promoted coffee table souvenir book and the more readily available stamp panes of four. Each "keepsake" collection catalogues $22.50 in Unitrade. A great investment/dealer lot. Face value alone is $119.56. Original retail was over $600.00! Total 2023 Unitrade =	$1,372.50	$140.00
3762
175	Canada - Turn back the clock - used wholesale stock in envelopes. Not one, not two, but THREE U-Haul boxes worth compiled from four or five different sources. Strength is in late KGV era up to about 2010. Thousands upon thousands of stamps with a mix of definitives and commemoratives. By definition, most of the material will be common, but a spot check showed some better (such as 10 copies of the 1933 Regina Grain overprint), but this is for the patient collector who likes to separate wheat from chaff. There is some loose on-paper material here too (just in case you needed more to sort through). Estimate =	$250.00	$120.00
6395
176	Canada - U-haul "book box", with Canadian collection "orphans". Lot includes a Darnell album, a couple of stockbooks, some loose album and stock pages, five old metal cigarette tins, an "Irvings Candies" box and a 60-year dealer’s box of envelopes (the box is 60 years old, we don’t know how old the dealer was) and a recipe box with "102" cards (QV-fairly recent). A quick flip through shows mostly used material. There are sorting lots of low denomination Small Queens, a couple dozen Map stamps, a couple of Bluenoses and a healthy grouping of back of the book (dues, airmail, special delivery, precancels etc). Expect duplication and mixed condition in places. As always, there is cancel potential and potential "finds" for the patient collector. One cubic foot of fun! Estimate =	$160.00	$170.00
4453

5557
181	Canada Covers - British Columbia / Admiral Postal History. Hoard of Victoria BC tax notices covers from late WWI to the early 1920’s, all Admiral franked and stamped "Return to Sender" with a pointing hand rubber stamp (no contents). While most are Victoria, we did note a few from other communities. Occasionally there are other postal markings from being returned mail, making for a great study of returned mail postmarks. Overall condition is quite decent, with 800 covers in total. We have also included a group of 150 Vancouver commercial covers with meter impression, most 1950’s-1960’s, duplicated, but some nice business corner cards. Estimate =	$250.00	$110.00
6150
182	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Bayard BC 1905 split ring postmark on Edward VII franked postcard (Cranbrook, Warwick Patriotic) sent to Sweden.

Located 8 miles east of Cranbook, serving the community and employees of the Bayard Saw Mill. Rated as an "E" in Topping / Robinson and "E1" (1-3 copies known) in Coopers monograph. A scarce BC town, worthy of any collection. Estimate =	$250.00	$350.00
1393

4178
185	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Small bin filled with 746 covers, from the QEII period (with a few older). A cancel collector's accumulation, with focus on the more modern (1990's - 2000's) RC "Retail Centre" boxed postmarks, which have been an under-appreciated facet of postal history as they represent a huge variety of postmark types, little of which has been researched. We also noted that a good number of these modern covers were sent registered, so perhaps some interest here for the modern "rate" collector. Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00
1393
186	Canada Covers - British Columbia Postal History. Vancouver BC advertising cover lot of 88 different, mostly 1920’s with terrific corner cards or notable return addresses, each with the stamp tied by a slogan cancel. Includes companies such as "Jones Tent and Awning", "Gailners", Vi-Tone and "The Cave". There are a number with Chinese language return addresses which have been very popular for those collectors of "diaspora" material. Noted themes like Vancouver’s 60th Jubilee, bicycles, rice, flour, engines, car service, soda etc. A fascinating look at Vancouver’s commercial past. Perfect to break-up for retail or to build onto this exhibit. Condition is generally very good, coming from a meticulous collector. A difficult to duplicate offering. Estimate =	$200.00	$1,175.00
4728
187	Canada Covers - Calgary Stampede and Exhibition 1947-1961 group of 24 illustrated cachet / special exhibition cancel covers. A nice array of covers from the late GeoVI to early QEII period, with some duplication in years, but often selected for variety in date. An always popular area of collecting as these covers were created by both collectors and attendees as a souvenir of "The Greatest Show on Earth". Estimate =	$120.00	$46.00
4858
188	Canada Covers - First Day Cover Hoard 1971-2008. Bankers Box filled with a total of 1830 first day covers, all with Canada Post issued cachets. While duplicated at time, this group offers a large selection of singles, se-tenant, blocks, plate blocks and sets. While these covers sold at a premium over face-value at time of purchase, we have only counted the total face value. Total face value =	$894.66	$110.00
6514
189	Canada Covers - First Day Covers. Small shoebox, filled with 244 Canada Post issue first day covers from the mid-1990's up to about 2012. A slightly duplicated group, but with strength in the more "modern" material including at least couple dozen souvenir sheets (including a good showing from the "P" stamp period). We also noted a good variety of both singles and sets and even some plate blocks (which are less common to see in the modern material). While these covers sold for a premium over the face value originally, we have only counted the total face value. Total face value =	$484.60	$120.00
5979
190	Canada Covers - Old-time Postal Stationery hoard (originally housed in a home-made plywood box before we removed them) with about 500 pieces of mint and used postal stationery, from the 1870’s until about 1985 (being mostly covers / postcards). We noted over 50 QV postal cards with printed notices for banks, 3 QEII pre-cancelled post cards with TB notices, a bundle of 2c KEVII envelopes used over a decade (perfect to learn how to differentiate the die types), a 1c KGVI wrapper perforated 4-hole OHMS and some more modern used envelopes with added cachets for stamp shows / "Conestoga Press". Usual amount of small faults, but generally a clean lot with moderate to heavy duplication. Estimate =	$150.00	$150.00
2189
191	Canada Covers - Ontario Postal History. Small plastic tub FILLED with a total of 1031 covers or postcards, all featuring Ontario postmarks including CDS, split ring, POCON, RC (retail centre) and machines. Accumulated by a collector over a number of years that was attempting to acquire postmarks from every Post Office across the country. Primarily QEII era, with strength in the 1960's to 1980's material including some obscure looking material from smaller Post Offices. A great lot for the postmark hound. Estimate =	$140.00	$210.00
6148
192	Canada Covers - Postal Stationery Accumulation. A small box containing a collector's "set aside for later" group of unused postal stationery including both envelopes (primarily), aerogrammes and postcards. Includes a few Post Office sealed packs from the 45c / 46c era and some "Automotive Forum" printed stationery. Lots of variety here to keep what you need and use the remainder to trade or use for mailing. These stationery lots have been popular with those who look to save on their mailing cost by uprating (with stamps) these and using them to mail today. Conservatively valued by the total usable postage value, with a clear upside if valued by an older Unitrade or current Webb catalogue. Total face value =	$226.41	$60.00
5979
193	Canada Covers - QEII official "G" Government OVPT franking covers, an old-time hoard. A fascinating box containing several hundred covers and "cut down" large pieces, all bearing QEII era "G" official frankings with strength in the Karsh and Wilding series. It does not look like this box has been opened in decades, with covers still bundled together likely stowed away sometime in the 1960's. Unchecked and un-researched. A great opportunity to acquire such a large holding. Estimate =	$150.00	$240.00
3579
194	Canada Covers - Small box containing over 300 covers and postcards, primarily Edward VII to QEII with strength in the GeoV material. Noted town cancels, RPO's, postal stationery, picture postcards, meters and first flight covers (FFC) to name a few. A good sort needed but this should prove rewarding for the Canadian postal historian. Estimate =	$120.00	$180.00
6150
195	Canada Covers / Literature - Proof Strikes of Canada. Group of 28 different soft-bound volumes (of the 38 volume set) of the "Proof Strikes of Canada" reference books Edited by J. Paul Hughes and published by Robert A. Lee Ltd. Perhaps the most important work ever done for Canadian postal history collectors, showing examples of Canadian postmarks QV to QEII compiled from what was available in the National Archives. Original cost over $800.00 for the complete set (so over $20 per volume). Estimate =	$200.00	$450.00
5803

3552
210	China - Accumulation in 6 albums, binders / stockbooks. Includes mounted collections, dealer stock and unorganized duplicate pages. Most are pre-1949 Republic issues, but there is a bit of early PRC and some deeper ROC to be found. This is another picker’s delight, with most of the issues being only superficially organized. Thousands of mint and used stamps, with hours of discovery for the successful bidder. Estimate =	$300.00	$1,825.00
1073
211	China - Over FOUR solid inches (10cm for you younger collectors) of loose album and stock pages, from over 20 different sources with a buffet of thousands of mint and used stamps, mostly from the first half of the 20th century but trickling into the early PRC and Taiwan issues. This is a sorter and researcher’s paradise. Much of this material has not been touched since the early 1980’s, well before increased interest from North American collectors, so who knows what is here. There is room to differentiate printings, overprints, cancels. To sweeten the pot, there is also a "personal pizza" sized box stuffed with envelopes, dealer cards and even an old approval book with even more material of a similar vintage. Estimate =	$500.00	$280.00
5719
212	China - Overwhelming accumulation of overprints in a clutch of loose album pages, loose in envelopes and glassines.

At least a couple of thousand stamps (not including non-overprinted issues or those from other areas that are on adjoining pages). Completely unchecked for printings, postmarks or errors. Unpicked, so we are confident that an expert (or someone wanting to become an expert), will thoroughly enjoy this lot. Estimate =	$300.00	$170.00
6255
213	China - The last from the Chinese "find", an array of album pages, stockpages and envelopes of miscellaneous material. Includes lots of Republic issues, then moving into Taiwan and PRC issues. As unpicked as the other lots. We have presumed that the earlier PRC material is mostly reprints but check them out for yourself. From many different sources. Most of this material hasn’t been touched in 40+ years. A good opportunity here for the patient collector as large untouched lots of this type of material (as with the other lots) is seldom offered. Estimate =	$250.00	$325.00
3111

77
221	China - PRC - Bundle of album pages, stockpages, dealer cards and two presentation albums (2000 year set and 30th anniversary of the annexation of Tibet). Most is from the Liberation era up to the 1960’s. We have presumed that much of the material from this period is reprint, but given the era and sources, some original material is likely to be found. We noted about 25 glassines with the 1963 Panda set, CTO (catalogue value over $300.00 alone). Be open to positive surprises in this lot, as they are bound to be there! Estimate =	$350.00	$180.00

225	France #715. Anti-Bolshevik Expeditionary Corps Souvenir Sheet. VF mint NH example of the 1941 issue WWII French Volunteer Legion F + 100F "Polar Bear" souvenir sheet of one. This sheet was issued to raise funds for the French Legion anti-Bolshevik Expeditionary Corps. In October 1941, the French infantry regiment (638th), 2,452 men strong, crossed the frontier of the Soviet Union as part of the foreign contingent of the German invasion force. Needless to say, not many returned. An evocative piece of WWII ephemera. Light gum bend mentioned for the record, but does not detract from this key-item. Listed in Michel catalogue as Private Ausgaben 1939/1945 Frankreich Block I. Only 30,000 sheets printed Michel cat 500 euros=	$728.25	$350.00

5959
230	France and French Colonies Cartonload - Wine box packed with albums, stock sheets and loose pages, containing a mixed selection of many hundreds of French Colonies and France proper. A quick inspection revealed: a fat Scott binder containing a wide range of colonial material; worthwhile selections of Gabon, Dahomey, Reunion and Chad organized on stock sheets (former auction lots); Loose album pages including France Back of the Book material; and finally remaindered France collection in a Minuteman binder. A useful mix with a decent total catalogue value. Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
5190

Includes both mint Hinged and used material, with additional used copies collected for the different cancellations. 100 stamps in total. Owner's 2013 Scott US$1,001.15 =	$1,351.55	$95.00

A great lot! Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
4466
235	French Offices in China - Overprints on French "Indo-Chine" issues. Includes Tchongking (Chungking) mint issues #11,14,15 (catalogue US$192.50) plus another six issues without Chinese characters, which Scott says "were not officially authorized". The pair of stamps from Mongtseu (Mengtsz) #10,12 are also mint, hinged (catalogue US$225.00) and finishes with Packhoi #13 (catalogues US$47.50). Very uncommon material, with great appeal for French colonial, China and even Vietnam collectors. Estimate =	$200.00	$75.00
5742

4038
237	German Democratic Republic, Germany, Saar - Trio of collections, arranged on older 18-ring Lindner pages (two within matching binders) with a good range of mint and used issues up to about 1960. We noted the best material is from DDR, with Mao set used, all four Marx souvenir sheets mint (hinged), 1953 portrait issue and some matching BOB including the Stamp Day 1950 souvenir sheet (never hinged). The Deutschland is two sets of pages in one binder, covering 1923-1945, with good coverage but generally missing the more expensive stamps and no souvenir sheets. The Saar issues are on pages (no binder) with an inter-war and post-war sections. Again, reasonable coverage, but not a lot of better items. The true value here is in the DDR. Estimate =	$200.00	$230.00
5241
238	Germany #29/1192. Massive duplicated "doubles" stock of 1870's to 1980's off-paper stamps, neatly sorted by catalogue number into envelopes within three shoeboxes. Many thousands of stamps in total, with strength in the definitive issues (including postmark interest), especially the 3rd Reich Wartime and Post-WWII issues. A very clean offering, with some surprises likely to be found throughout. Estimate =	$160.00	$110.00
5907
239	Germany - An explosion of 1980s "Muster" overprints on 446 German stamps (including semi-postals) and four souvenir sheets, plus an additional 31 overprints on Berlin issues. The condition appears to be very fine mint, never hinged, as released by the German post office as specimens. The disorganization makes it difficult to determine how much duplication there is, but it appears to be moderate, perfect for helping you recoup your purchase price. Housed in an expensive brown leatherette KABE 32-page black acetate strip stockbook. Estimate =	$400.00	$85.00
2271
240	Germany - Computer generated album covering up to 2012, with a couple thousand mostly used stamps. We note that this looks very complete post-WWII (but no "back of the book"). There are pages for States (noted many Bavarian issues) and "Kolonies" with each page being individually housed in page protectors. What adds intrigue to this already solid collection is that many of the earlier pages from earlier issues have scatterings of unmounted material that has been slid into the page protector, sometimes dozens of stamps at a time. Not sure if these were duplicates, or better condition/nice cancels that had been set aside, but it definitely gives the feeling of hidden possibilities. The lot also includes a second binder with 20 manilla stockpages with similar, duplicate material from the same time period. Estimate =	$220.00	$130.00
5907
241	Germany - Der hodgen-podgen with a bit of Germany, then lots of Bavaria and DDR. The Germany includes 8 larger sized custom album pages with attractive semi-postal issues (1936-1941), some larger inflation-era multiples, an old international reply coupon and some 1970’s material in 102 cards. The Bavaria includes a couple of mounted collections (owner’s catalogue value over $500.00) with some nice cancels noted. The East German material includes a couple of sets of album pages and a few auction lots that between them, cover much of what was issued, with a few later souvenir sheets noted. Good potential throughout. Estimate =	$160.00	$130.00
5621
242	Germany Literature - Specialized offering of 15 different volumes, all relating to Germany and States postal history and cancellation information. Pertaining to a range of topics from early stampless material to the beginning of the 20th century. While all of these books are in German, many can still be easily navigated by the anglophone, such as "Deutsche Postorte 1490-1920" which translates to "German Postal Locations" that list alphabetically the Post Offices of Germany 1490-1920 with location. This grouping would easily represent many hundred of dollars in original cost. Estimate =	$140.00	$200.00
6522
243	Germany Postal History - Shoebox containing an old-time accumulation of post-WWII postal history primarily 1946-1957, plus a group of earlier Bavaria postal stationery postcards. Several hundred items in total, with a nice array of usages put aside by a specialist in German postal history. The Bavaria stationery cards are a mix of both mint and used, with a good showing of the "Germania" time period (and earlier). Estimate =	$150.00	$55.00
3208
244	Germany Postal History - Wurttemberg Postal History / Postal Stationery Holding. A very interesting collector's accumulation of roughly 250 covers, postcards and wrappers with strength in the postal stationery (both used and unused). These were put together over many years by a German specialist and seem to have a particular focus on the postmarks of the 1880's. An attractive and clean offering. Estimate =	$200.00	$140.00
3208
245	Germany, DDR and States - Interesting accumulation including a stockbook of the 2pf postal tax stamp of 1948-50, with over 1000 copies and 25 covers (a motherlode for the specialist). Then there are a dozen inflation era complete mint sheets, a few older albums (most without binders), stamps back to the various States (with the usual caveats about the ever-mixed condition of this material) and some earlier DDR. There are over 100 black stockcards with individual GDR/DDR sets (1970’s-80s), with Scott notations and pricing on the back (probably $300.00 catalogue value here alone). The lot concludes with some stocksheets with various souvenir sheets and modern presentation cards. Estimate =	$170.00	$40.00
5883
246	Gibraltar #9/218, J1-J3, MR1. All mint Hinged 1886 to 1968 period collection of over 140 different stamps, including numerous high quality complete sets. All neatly mounted on the original Stanley Gibbons printed album pages and on one Hagner stock sheet. The collection becomes comprehensive in the later GeoVI and QEII period but the earlier section, while a bit thinner, still contains useful and better singles. 2022 Scott US$1,007.85 =	$1,360.60	$120.00
3552
247	Great Britain #1. Fine to Very Fine used example of the 1840 issue Penny Black, the world's first stamp. Four clear margins and a nice strike of the Maltese Cross cancel. Unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$375.00 =	$506.25	$160.00
5959
248	Great Britain #1. Penny Black Study Group #1. A grouping of 5 un-plated Penny Blacks, including a 3-margin copy and a couple of 2+ margin copies, most of which have red Maltese Cross postmarks. Expect the usual small faults. A great lot for plate study or sheet reconstruction. 2023 Scott US$1875.00 =	$2,431.25	$170.00
5010
249	Great Britain #1. Penny Black Study Group #2. A second un-plated selection of 5 Penny Blacks, including a copy with a tight 4-margin and then 3x 3-margins, most of which have Maltese Cross postmarks. Expect the usual small faults in the lot. A nice chance to acquire a group, perfect for study of plates or sheet reconstruction. 2023 Scott US$1875.00 =	$2,431.25	$150.00
5010
250	Great Britain #1a. The Scott Classic and Stanley Gibbons listed intense black shade of the 1840 issue Penny Black, VF appearing but faulty (thinned) used with a cancel so light it appears to be mint at first glance. Full to huge margins on all sides. Take a good look at the scan as the stamp is unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$600.00 =	$810.00	$120.00
6301
251	Great Britain #1a. The Scott Classic and Stanley Gibbons listed intense black shade of the 1840 issue Penny Black, VF used with a light red Maltese Cross cancel. Take a good look at the scan as the stamp is unchecked for plate number. 2023 Scott Classic US$600.00 =	$810.00	$180.00
6108
252	Great Britain #3/1091. Fine mostly used collection on quadrilled pages with some notable items that includes some early Victorian material with a number of strong readable cancels. The Jubilee issue includes three values with perfins, the KEVII is covered up to the 5/-. (noted four Seahorses..one perfined) and the Elizabethan period up to 1985 which appears free of definitives. Usual mixed condition, but good appearance (with few obvious faults). A good clean offering. Owner’s total 2022 Scott US$2917.00 =	$3,937.95	$70.00
6032
253	Great Britain #26/125. There is no truth to the assertion that this was the childhood stamp collection of Edward Scissorhand..however, the previous owner felt it was more expedient to cut out pages from albums and notebooks than to remount the stamps elsewhere. The good news is that the collector had a good eye for attractive used Queen Victoria issues. There are a baker’s dozen of pages (13), with a total of 115 stamps, up to 1/- denominations. Lots of notes identifying individual stamps, printings and plates, but we have not verified any of these so take a good look at the scans to judge for yourself. Based on the listed Scott catalogue values, it doesn’t appear that this material has been handled since at least the 1980s. Great postmark potential throughout. Total lowest 2023 Scott US$2,522.00 =	$3,404.70	$120.00
4613
254	Great Britain #33, 58 (Plates). All mint (mostly no gum) selection of 1864 issue perforated "Penny Reds" (plates #171, 174, 186, 214 & 221) and a trio of ½p rose "Bantams" (valued as the most common plate). Expect the odd fault. 2023 Scott Classic US$882.50 =	$1,191.38	$80.00
1837
255	Great Britain #70. VF used wing margin strip of three of the 1877 issue 4p pale olive green, wmk 23 (Large Garter), plate 16. This light colour is close to the true shade. 2023 Scott Classic US$1,050.00 =	$1,417.50	$55.00
1837
256	Great Britain #96a. Used example of the 1883 2sh6p lilac QV large format high value on the Scott and Stanley Gibbons listed bluish paper. Partial CDS postmark. A very rare Victorian era paper variety. This stamp is new to the market as we found it in a 19th Century "old-time" collection. Short perfs at upper right noted for the record, otherwise sound. 2024 Scott US$1,750.00 =	$2,362.50	$150.00
2271
257	Great Britain #111-122, 125-138, 143-145, 147-150. Sixty-two used stamps from the late Victorian era and the subsequent Edward issues running from 1887-1911. Stamps are generally Fine to Very Fine and sound, including many colour variations. No attempt has been made to include all such varieties but the major ones are shown, all identified by the consignor. The stamps have been selected for mainly unobtrusive cancels with pleasing appearance. Consignor's 2019 Scott US$1,972.30 =	$2,662.61	$80.00
6008
258	Great Britain #127/145. A half-page of mint Edwardian issues 1/2d - 10d (1/- value isn’t counted). Very fresh appearance, with the back ranging from barely hinged to a couple that are quite heavily hinged. A few duplicates included, but also unchecked for colour shades (see the trio of 9d values). 2023 Scott US$1,338.00 =	$1,806.30	$150.00
4588
259	Great Britain #179/223. Herd of Seahorses. Group of 19 used examples, unchecked for printings but a quick glance shows at least two printings are represented. These stamps are striking with their above average quality of cancels. There are 7 copies of the 2/6, 10 of the 5/- and two non-Waterlow examples of the 10/-. Expect the odd fault, as often found on these "high-value" issues. Catalogued as the cheapest examples only. Total 2023 Scott US$1075.00 =	$1,451.25	$85.00
3121
260	Great Britain #181. Mint Hinged 10/- Seahorse from the 1919 Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co printing, complete with the tiny dot above the top centre frame. A bit of usual gum cracking and the number "200" has been written on the back in pencil but has a nice fresh appearance. 2023 Scott US$340.00 =	$459.00	$150.00
6032
261	Great Britain #267-268 First Day Cover. The 1948 KGVI and Queen Mother Silver Wedding set of two on a spectacularly attractive small format Registered cover, neatly written address, mailed from Kirriemuir, Scotland with clear CDS date "26-AP-48". Superb condition. The care with which this cover was prepared and mailed is clearly evident! Stanley Gibbons Concise catalouge value £425.00 =	$720.00	$70.00
6128
262	Great Britain #J43/54. Group of better mint (mostly never hinged), early Elizabethan postage dues. Includes J43 (x3), J44 (heavily hinged), J46, J48, J53 (x2), J54 (x2). Build your collection and recoup some of your money with the duplicates! 2023 Scott US$689.25 =	$930.49	$90.00
3961
263	Great Britain #O4/O73. Selection of sixteen lightly duplicated used and one mint Official stamps from 1882-1903. The consignor notes Parcel stamps are particularly interesting and include the 1sh value (#O36). Mainly sound with the odd fault noted. Consignor's 2019 Scott US$470.80 =	$635.58	$50.00
3773
264	Great Britain #O47. The "O.W. OFFICIAL" overprint on 5d Queen Victoria Jubilee, for use by the Office of Works in 1901. Nice light CDS cancel on a very difficult issue. 2024 Scott US$1,250.00 =	$1,687.50	$190.00
5742
265	Great Britain - A pair of Hagner brand stockpages with 122 very assorted Victorian issues up to 5/-. These appear to have been selected for their readable cancels, with approximately 90% quite easily identified at first glance. Includes many better items, with individual catalogue values up to $300.00 each (and several perfins for those who appreciate the "holy" stamps). While there are a few that are noticeably damaged, the vast majority are quite clean and attractive. Unchecked by us for printings, plates, etc. Catalogued as the cheapest possible option. Total 2023 Scott US$2058.00 =	$2,778.30	$150.00
3266
266	Great Britain - Binders, album pages, packets and presentation packs. Bankers box filled with an assortment of material including used Victorian era issues (some better values and nice readable cancels), bits from KEVII - KGVI (one old auction lot was stated to catalogue US$870.00 in 2012!) and then strong QEII with a bit of Machins and lots of used commemoratives from about 1990-2010. Also included is a bit of Channel Islands material (for the record). Thousands of stamps, a few covers.. and hours of hunting and sorting. Estimate =	$150.00	$38.00
4406
267	Great Britain - Dense bankers box containing several albums with mostly used GB collections or stocks. There is potential value everywhere, including better QV & KEVII stamps, a number of Seahorses and commemoratives into the early 21st century. Amongst the thousands of stamps, there are other "plus value" items waiting to be found, including cancels, varieties and perfins. Great to build your collection, your online stock or to make friends at an upcoming stamp club meeting! Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
6466
268	Great Britain - Five pages of complete QEII booklets, most being Machin issues. Includes three different 4/6 booklets (all numbers and values by Gibbons) L12, L19, L59p and 2 different 6/- booklets = QP28 & QP36. These 5 booklets alone catalogue £197.00! Next is a series of 46 mostly different "machine" booklets from the early 1990’s (another £150.00 value). Finally, there are seven booklets from the "two Queens" Machin issue, a couple of the early prestige booklets and (although not technically booklets) the large panes of the Christmas 1986 and 1987 issues. Overall condition is excellent, except for the Wedgewood booklet that has a cover scuff and is not counted in the catalogue value. Total 2017 Stanley Gibbons Concise £418.00 =	$689.70	$130.00
6128
269	Great Britain - Mr. Hodge meet Ms. Podge. This bundle of Britannia includes a range of 35 Presentation packs with some going back to the early 1970’s, but most from the 1990’s up to 2009 and a further 13 packs from Guernsey. Unhelpfully, the owner sometimes added used stamps to the packs (the mint still all appear to be there, with the later decimal-era face value being £92.00). Mixed in with these packs are 37 First Day Covers, including some signed (noted David Attenborough). There are a couple old auction lots on single pages, one with mint, mostly NH phosphor taggings and the other with BEE (British Empire Exhibition) to 1960’s mint, being a mostly lightly hinged selection (both pages catalogue about $200.00). For those seeking more modern commemoratives, there are 17 Vario brand pages with both sides filled with mostly circa 2000’s used GB (expect some duplication). Estimate =	$150.00	$230.00

270	Great Britain - QEII Machin Stamp HOARD. An astounding accumulation of over 20,000 used QEII "Machin Head" definitive stamps (including regional issues) on/off paper, with the majority being off-paper. Sorted and semi-sorted into envelopes and small boxes, filing two small size U-haul boxes. Designed by Arnold Machin and featuring a simple sculpted profile of the Queen, these "Machin" stamps were issued between 1967-2022 and have always had a strong collector base due to the many varieties that can be found. A great lot for sorting. Estimate =	$200.00	$42.00
3208
271	Great Britain - Used Hoard on Stock Pages. Semi-organized mixed condition accumulation of 1840s to 1960s period stamps, including regular issues, Officials, postal stationery cut-squares, Revenues and more. Strength noted in early Victorian issues and GeoV Seahorses. Saw a couple of Penny Blacks, perf and imperf Two Penny Blues (including multiples), quantities of better Victorian era singles and more. While a good number of faulty stamps can be expected in a "catch-all" lot like this, there is a good chance of finding a "gem" or two here as the long-time accumulation appears to be unpicked for varieties. The total theoretical catalogue value runs into the thousands! Estimate =	$325.00	$375.00
3732
272	Great Britain - Used QEII Machin holding of 52 mostly different booklet panes 1990-2008, most with first day cancellations including some regional issues. Some were soaked from FDCs, while others may have been self-created based on differences in selvage and cancellation type. Generally the condition is good, but expect a bit of pressing needed on a couple. All arranged within a lovely 16-page acetate strip stockbook with a blue cover. This material is missing from most modern UK collections. Estimate =	$150.00	$80.00
6008
273	Great Britian / Channel Islands - Postal History group. A collector's assembly of 124 covers and postcards, neatly packed within a small box. The lot consists of Guernsey (55), Isle of Man (31) and Jersey (38). Lots of attractive stamps throughout, being mostly sets on cachet first day covers (but with odd commercial item mixed in). We even noted a WWII Jersey occupation cover, of philatelic origin (but most are). Estimate =	$100.00	$32.00
3613
274	Greenland #10-18. Complete set of the 1945 "American" issue, each with a light partial CDS cancel in the upper corner. Condition is excellent and the appearance is fresh. One of the more classic Scandinavian issues. 2023 Scott US$360.00 =	$486.00	$110.00
6008
275	Griqualand West #87c. Fine mint OG H example of the 1878 issue 1/2p grey black Seated Britannia with 2nd "G" overprint (t) in red. 2023 Scott Classic US$350.00 =	$472.50	$70.00
6087
276	Guadeloupe #2/199 plus back of the book. Mounted collection covering about 80% of the colonial period for this French Caribbean colony, including overprinted issues back to 1884. There is good representation from the overprinted era and many nice cancels noted (a couple of damaged items, including #38, are not counted). The commemorative and common design sets are mostly intact and there are semi-postals, airmails and later postage dues. Also included are a few stamps on Harris pages not counted in the total 2023 Scott US$812.75 =	$1,097.20	$85.00
6522
277	Hong Kong #5/1156. Dealer’s stock of mostly used issues sorted into glassines by Scott number, with a few album pages and some loose stamps from a separate holding. In total, there is a bit of QV (including a couple of Treaty Port cancels), a couple of QV private overprints or "firm chops" (including on #52, catalogues $140.00) and a smattering of KEVII and KGV. There is a goodly bunch of 1941 Centenary issues, including 40 used copies of the dollar denomination (#173 - cat $9.25 each, most in pairs or strips of three - if only those covers or pieces had survived!). The material is stronger in definitives than commemoratives and goes up to just past the handover to China. A couple of thousand stamps, perfect to fill in your collection or to break into smaller lots. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
2299
278	Hong Kong #151/238. All mint Hinged 1937 to 1968 period collection of 67 different stamps, all high quality complete definitive and commemorative sets. The collection includes four different GeoVI period sets and QEII period seems to be complete from 1952 up to 1968. 2024 Scott US$705.95 =	$953.03	$75.00
2958
279	Hong Kong #559a. Mint NH souvenir sheets issued for the Royal Visit of the Charles and Diana to Hong Kong in 1989. Pristine lot of 100 mint never hinged copies, still in the original post office packaging. 2023 Scott US$1650.00 =	$2,227.50	$110.00
269
280	Hong Kong #791a. Opening of Lantau Link bridge souvenir sheet with perf 13.5 in a brick of 500 mint, never -hinged examples, still packed as they came from the Post Office. Issued in 1997 in the lead-up to the handover back to China, these stamps were valid for postage for only a couple of months after issue. The consignor originally paid HK$2500.00 ($415.00 CDN) as a new issue. 2023 Scott US$1125.00 =	$1,518.75	$110.00
269
281	Hong Kong #792. Mint NH "Classics No.10" souvenir sheet depicting notable definitives stamps of the previous 150 years. The last issue before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration in 1997. Housed in a box that originally contained 500 souvenir sheets, but the seal has been broken and we suspect that a few have been removed, so we are going to conservatively estimate this lot based on 450 souvenir sheets (there are definitely more than that). The original cost would have been about $380.00 CDN. 2023 Scott US$787.50 =	$1,063.73	$110.00
269
282	Hong Kong - 1980’s sheet lot, in complete sets with each issue having either one or two complete mint never hinged sheets (with gutter pairs). Includes the Port issue, historic building, Charles and Diana Royal Visit and Hong Kong’s only semi-postal issue. Scott catalogue numbers #380-383 (x50), 439-442 (x100), 556-559 (x100) and B1-B4 (x100), with one sheet of B1 with toning on back, so not counted in the catalogue value. Great for display or to break up for sale. Also included is a set of sheetlets from the first Hong Kong issue by China (also not included in the total catalogue value). 2023 Scott US$3402.50 =	$4,593.38	$120.00
269
283	Hungary #486, B108, B109, B130, B202, B203, C67, C157. Group of 8 VF used souvenir sheets from the 1934-1954 period. Includes the 1934 sheet (admission) to the 2nd Hungarian Philatelic Exhibition, 1939 Protestant Day (both perforate and imperforate), 1940 "Artists" semi-postal, 1947 Stamp Day, 1948 "Globe and Carrier Pigeon", 1949 "Postman" airmail and 1954 Stamp Day "Jokai". A clean group of souvenir sheets, with only one small bend noted (B203). 2023 Scott US$200.00 =	$270.00	$48.00
6008
284	Hungary #B198A-B198D, CB1-CB1C. Matching mint Never Hinged duo of the 1947 Franklin Delano Roosevelt semi-postal / airmail semi-postal souvenir sheets. Couple minor gum bends as are almost always found on these issues, but well above average. 2023 Scott US$250.00 =	$337.50	$48.00
3634
285	Iran #1253/2549. A dozen black stockpages that start with 1963-1964 issues, including #1253/1313 and 1971 with #1581/1636 (these all have the usual light gum-side tanning, endemic to these issues). The group then shifts to 600 different 1980’s-1992 issues, noting #2688, 2696, 2730, 2732, 2772, 2788-2789 and 2421-2436. All appear to be very fine, mint, never hinged but the occasional minor gum fault may exist. Modern Persian material is not often seen. Estimate =	$150.00	$85.00
6434
286	Italy #21/2499. A surprisingly good binder of club approvals, with pages being added up to 2002. Based on the observation that the catalogue values of the early material has gone up by 2-5 times, this group was likely started in the 1980s and we noted a number of $10-$40 items. There is a second binder with manila stockpages holding a confused selection of material, but includes lots of "back of the book" issues. There is a bit of value in some 1930’s commemoratives and mint end-of-the-war "GNR" overprints. A couple thousand stamps, mostly used. While this is definitely disorganized and duplicated, expect to make a few unexpected "finds". Estimate =	$150.00	$60.00
2299
287	Italy - Trieste #1/205 plus Back of the Book. Six-page accumulation of mint Italian stamps, overprinted AMG-FTT for the American Military government in Free Trieste at the end of the second world war. A good range of issues, many are never hinged, or lightly hinged and includes a bit of duplication. Includes the long sets of 1947 & 1948 and the 1951 "stamp on stamp" issue, plus some quality back of the book, including airmails and postage dues (amongst others). The last batch from this collection that we have been listing over the past few months. 2023 Scott US$1373.80 =	$1,845.63	$110.00
2299
288	Italy and Colonies - Accumulation from several sources, includes a couple dozen manila stockpages with a few hundred mostly used pre-1940 issues and some back of the book (the Roman states issues are mostly reprints). This is followed by a couple of un-touched auction lots including more and often later stamps on stockcards including a set of B17-B19 (the 1923 Black Shirt issue). There is then a mounted collection with some nice Eritrea & Somalia issues and 5 different used Italian issues overprinted for Zara/Zadar in 1943 (catalogue over $200.00 in Michel, but offered "as-is"). Estimate =	$150.00	$80.00
3961
289	Jamaica #16/265, MR1/MR11, O1-O3 Plus Fiscals. Lightly duplicated mixed mint Hinged and used 1883 to 1967 period collection of 412 stamps and souvenir sheets. The older material ends to be the used and duplicated portion of the lot while the more recent QEII stamps tend to be all different and in complete sets. 2024 Scott US$813.25 =	$1,097.89	$70.00
6522
290	Japan #58/2614. Red box of 102 cards, sorted into mint (30%), used (60%) and modern prefecture issues (10%). The used includes some striking 19th century SON cancels. The mint (mostly hinged) material includes some good values up to the 1950’s. Each stamp or set is properly identified with both Scott number and in many cases, the catalogue value. Noted many $3-$10 items throughout, with only light duplication. Great collection or stock builder. Estimate =	$150.00	$170.00
4533
291	Japan - Multiple part 20th century accumulation including a number of souvenir sheets, with a couple National Parks (1938, 1941) and 3 from 1948 (all 5 with usual faults, bends etc), plus some more recent. This is followed by a dozen more recent sheetlets of 20 (about equivalent C$100.00 face value). Then there is a 16-page Lighthouse stockbook, with mostly mint stamps from the 1980s (give or take) and a 1989 UPU conference delegation gift in a nice album with case. Finally, there are a couple album pages / stockpages and a handful of loose material with some items of promise. An explorer’s delight. Estimate =	$180.00	$180.00
269
292	Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania #46/180. Fine to Very Fine mint Hinged (mostly Very Fine and Lightly Hinged) and used collection of 125 different 1935 to 1967 period issues, almost all complete sets. Neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. All the QEII period material is mint, the earlier GeoV and GeoVI material is mixed mint and used. Great topical subject matter. 2024 Scott US$1,032.85 =	$1,394.35	$120.00
6136
293	Korea - Democratic People’s Republic (North) #608g. Fabulous mint never-hinged souvenir sheet issued in 1966 for the 20th anniversary of the Korean Worker’s Party, depicting typical Communist themes such as Marx/Lenin, red flags with yellow emblems etc. Sheet was cut a bit off-kilter (as often seen), but it is square. A bit of printing offset visible at the top, does not diminish this scarce piece. 2023 Scott US$600.00 =	$810.00	$42.00
1073
294	Kuwait #155/260. All fresh and Fine to Very Fine mint Hinged (mostly Very Fine and Lightly Hinged) collection of 110 different 1961 to 1964 period issues, all complete sets. Neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. Great topical subject matter. 2024 Scott US$253.60 =	$342.36	$30.00
1202
295	Latin America - Hoard from a collector who bought more than he could process. This box is a range of old album pages, dealer stockcards, auction lots and some relatively recent new issues. All of which were purchased and then never processed, so found as received (some from decades ago). A wide range of countries, but with no particular concentration. In alphabetical order, we noted Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico (include a few complete sheets), Nicaragua, El Salvador and Venezuela. Collectors are finally appreciating the complexity and scarcity of this long-overlooked part of the world. Estimate =	$200.00	$260.00
3408
296	Leeward Islands #100/147. Complete run of 1937 to 1954 GeoVI and QEII sets, all fresh, VF mint and Very Lightly Hinged. This lot represents the final issues of this West Indies federation (abolished in 1956). 2024 Scott US$238.35 =	$321.77	$80.00
2712
297	Macao #365/704. Mint Sheet / Multiples Hoard. Enough complete sheets and large blocks to wallpaper a house, to entice an artist or to create a renaissance movement of collecting multiples. Includes #365 (100 copies), 372 (180), 373 (47), 383 (100 sheets!), 406 (138), 435 (100), 704 (100). All are mint and appear to be in excellent never hinged condition, having been handled little since they were new issues. Total 2023 Scott US$6332.90 =	$8,549.42	$70.00
2299
298	Malaya States and Straits Settlements - Eclectic mix on stockcards and album pages. We noted the best of the group is a Tregganu sextet of Japanese occupation (catalogue $198.50), Selangor Royal Wedding postally used and a nice selection of QV-KGV mint and used. There is also a range of "States" issues, with better singles. A bit of duplication and expect some odd faults (maybe even the occasional revenue cancel), but overall this is an unpicked lot accumulated by a collector from several sources. Estimate =	$140.00	$210.00
1496
299	Malta #8/396, J11/J25a, MR1-MR2. Mint and used 1885 to 1968 period collection, all mounted on Stanley Gibbons printed album pages. Comprehensive for the QEII period material, nearly complete for the GeoVI period, less complete in the earlier issues. 288 different stamps in total. Excellent basis for expansion. 2024 Scott US$643.75 =	$869.06	$55.00
3543
300	Malta #167/380, J11-J17. All fresh and Fine to Very Fine, all mint Hinged (mostly Very Fine and Lightly Hinged) collection of 212 different 1930 to 1967 period issues, all complete sets from 1937 up and all neatly laid out, identified and valued on four Hagner brand stock sheets. 2024 Scott US$521.25 =	$703.69	$110.00
5742
301	Manchukuo #1-18, plus 3 postal stationery cards. First Presentation Booklet of 1932 issues, with a complete set of the Manchukuo’s first issue (Scott catalogue as mint stamps $250.00), plus the three postal cards that were issued at the time. Many booklets of this time have the stamps cancelled, but not this version. A bit of minor wear and normal aging from the paper’s acidity. Still a scarce presentation booklet and a great addition to any Chinese or Japanese collection. Includes a 72-page publication produced by the International Society for Japanese Philately (Monograph 9, April 1981), with maps, lists of post offices and other reference material. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
4823
302	Nepal - Postal stationery. Balance of the stock of renowned dealer Geoff Flack, all identified by van der Wateren (specialized stationery catalogue). Most like items grouped in a large sleeve with a bit of a writeup and a suggested retail price. Comprising of mostly air letters (aerogrammes) and registered envelopes, with the postal cards and envelopes sold in previous auctions. Includes mint, used (both postally and CTO) with up to about 10 of a type. We think the numbering system of the envelopes matches his plan to sell them online. A fairly thorough look indicates that the quantities match the notes on the outside. We don’t have a copy of this catalogue to verify identification or pricing. Flack’s total Wateren catalogue value (year unknown) US$2863.00 = $3865.05 CDN (but un-verified). Estimate =	$250.00	$44.00
2712
303	Netherlands - Enticing four-part lot, including (in no particular order...1) Davo album with pages up to 1974 somewhat sparsely filled with a few hundred mostly used stamps. 2) "Back of the book", mostly used collection on Scott Specialty pages (catalogued US$224.00 in 2007). 3) Envelope with 1970’s-1980’s new issues and selection of older used stamps in an assortment of glassine envelopes. 4) Brown paper package with 1960-1980 maxi-cards, first day presentation programmes and cancelled information sheetlets (many of these with some light duplication, with about 150 items in total). Estimate =	$150.00	$36.00
6484
304	Netherlands Antilles, Curacao, Suriname, East Indies - Assortment of album bits, stockpages and auction lots. Most is all mixed together, awaiting your sorting skills. Includes some nice cancellations in the Dutch Indies, a tidy mounted collection of Curacao and a 1989 UPU presentation folder from the Antilles (given out to delegates). Lastly, there is a couple of sections of mounted collections from Holland itself. Estimate =	$140.00	$100.00
5295
305	New Zealand #13b. The 3p brown-lilac QV Chalon, locally printed issue of 1862, with serrated rouletted 16 perforation. Perfs are in good shape, strong "Star" watermark and a nice "C" in duplex killer (Christchurch) that is clear of Queen Victoria’s face. The reverse side of the stamp is in equally above-average condition, but a previous owner identified the stamp in ink as "20d", a number that doesn’t exist in Scott or Stanley Gibbons, with an equally obsolete catalogue value. A minor blemish on an otherwise beautiful stamp. 2023 Scott US$1850.00 =	$2,497.50	$120.00
5902
306	New Zealand #122-125. Christchurch Exhibition of 1906, complete mint set of four (in far better than normally seen condition). Notorious for its rough perforations, poor centering and variable image print quality, this set is fresh, with the perforations generally intact. The 1/2d is hinged, but the other three denominations are never hinged, with the 3d having what might be a natural gum "twinge" mentioned for the record. As hinged stamps, 2023 Scott US$461.00 =	$622.35	$170.00
5742
307	New Zealand #130/139a, O33/O49. King Edward VII exhibit starter on black stockpage. Includes regular issue, official overprints, and 4 plate proofs. Break out your Gibbons or Cambell Patterson, as there are perf and colour variations to be understood. Overall condition is above average, with a couple of the stamps being never hinged (most are hinged). Used singles and plate proofs not counted in the total catalogue value. 2023 Scott US$867.00 =	$1,170.45	$70.00
5742
308	New Zealand #144/164. Fifty-two stamps, mint and used (many both). Perforation and colour varieties are prominent. Extremely attractive and an excellent group for the advanced collector or for the budding specialist. Identification by the consignor. Owner's 2019 Scott US$546.50 =	$737.78	$80.00
5902
309	New Zealand #165/201. Selection of 1920-1935 issues. Sixty-two stamps in mainly Fine to Very Fine mint or used condition (with many both) and including many of the catalogued varieties. All identified by the consignor on two black Prinz-system pages. All stamps are sound but because of the black background, a few of the used stamps may appear in the photos to have edge faults. A truly attractive and very collectible lot. Owner's 2023 Scott US$992.00 =	$1,339.20	$100.00
5479
310	New Zealand #O82/86. Wholesale grouping of used 1940 Centennial issue overprinted "Official", includes 4d (x300), 6d (x500), 1/- (x390). Unchecked for "joined FF" variety. Overall condition looks good but expect the odd fault. Total 2023 Scott US$3327.50 =	$4,492.13	$28.00
2299
311	New Zealand - A chaotic bundle of Southern Hemisphere philately, desperately in need of a good sort. Some better items noted are some 1999-2003 "new issues", 25 First Day covers, stamp show issues, Lord of the Rings, souvenir sheets and sheetlets. Then, there are loose glassines with a random assortment of issues back to the 1940’s (both mint and used), pieces from albums and stockcards back to Victorian times (saw a mint hinged 1940 set) and a couple of envelopes with mint bulk multiples from the 1970s with face values that add up. Total face value of the modern stamps alone over NZ$250.00! Enjoy your dig! Estimate =	$200.00	$130.00
5735
312	New Zealand - Box and a binder duo lot. The box has about 275 illustrated cachet First Day covers, covering 1960’s-2002, with strength in the 1990’s with individual items to NZ$20.00 face value (noted 2x Cook souvenir sheet FDC with different illustrated cachets). Mixed in with these FDCs are some new issues, as received from the Post Office, mostly 1999-2002 with about NZ$75.00 face value. The binder has mint Health souvenir sheets B52a/B117a (up to 1986) very complete (most hinged) these catalogue US$410.00 ($553.50 CDN) alone! Estimate =	$160.00	$65.00
3613
313	New Zealand - FDC / Cover collection housed in a homemade wooden tray had to be sturdily built to handle the several hundred covers that are packed into it. The majority are cacheted first day covers, circa 1940-1990 (including some "Health" semi-postals); with the more recent ones unaddressed. A bit of duplication and possibly some different cachets amongst the earlier issues. Includes some commercial or philatelically inspired mail, including a bit of postal stationery. Expect some light duplication and a few faults but overall this is a nice clean lot with lots of value throughout. Estimate =	$150.00	$65.00
3613
314	New Zealand - Starter Collection in a Box. Mint H/NH and used collection of hundreds of stamps and souvenir sheets, housed in four different albums (and loose). The group consists of: early 20th century up to 1960s on quadrille pages; 1960s to 1990s period material in a Stanley Gibbons album; mid-1980s to mid-1990s on special illustrated an annotated New Zealand hingeless pages; and finally, 1996 to 2002 period material in a Stanley Gibbons album. A bit messy but still a great basis for expansion. Estimate =	$150.00	$130.00
6104
315	New Zealand - Two part group, combined to entice. Includes a fairly complete run of mint issues 1993-1997, with lots of souvenir sheets (with some Philatelic Exhibition printings) and a few Ross Dependencies issues. All appear to be VF never hinged. Face value alone of this first batch is NZ$375.00 ($301.00 CDN). The second part is a couple of bundles of "102" cards from an old dealer stock (prices based on ’92 Scott!), generally 1930-1980 with both mint and used. We noted some Health issues and1940 Centennial (regular and official) mixed in amongst the more common material. Conservatively valued for the total face value alone NZ$375.00 =	$301.00	$160.00
5991
316	New Zealand Dependencies - Two Hagner brand stocksheets brandishing 103 stamps, being mostly pre-1930 mint New Zealand issues overprinted for use on the smaller Pacific Islands. Lot includes Aitutaki ($164.00), Cook Islands / Rarotonga ($197.85), Niue ($85.75), Penrhyn Islands ($69.30) and Samoa ($48.50). Most with typical heavy hinging but catalogued as the cheapest variety in Scott (unchecked for papers, perforation, overprint types/colours/errors etc). Total 2023 Scott US$565.40 =	$763.29	$60.00
5991
317	Niue #3/120. All sound and Fine-Very Fine mint Hinged collection of 1902-1967 period issues, 132 different stamps in total, almost all in complete sets. All neatly laid out on two Hagner stock sheets. 2023 Scott Classic US$555.55 =	$750.00	$190.00
5560
318	North Borneo #38/296. Almost all Very Fine mint Lightly Hinged (some earlier used included) collection of 79 different 1887 to 1963 period issues. The bulk of the value is in GeoVI and early QEII period material and is all in complete sets. All neatly laid out on three Hagner brand stock sheets. 2023 Scott US$634.75 =	$856.91	$190.00
2712
319	Northern Rhodesia #1/88. All Very Fine and mint Light Hinge selection of 77 different 1925 to 1963 period issues, almost all in complete sets and all organized on two Hagner stocksheets.

We noted a stockbook with US$150.00 face value from the 1980’s-1990’s including lots of "ATM" booklet panes and coil strips. There are also a couple of metal cigarette tins holding common duplicates.

Lots of topical interest, including fish, ships, Princess Diana etc. The face value of these stamps is in US dollars which adds up quickly and would represent a decent investment as "new issues". Estimate =	$150.00	$50.00
2271
356	USA Covers - Specialized collection of the 1934 National Parks issue First Day Covers / commemorative covers (60 covers in total). An always popular series with collectors for the large variety of material to be found in both the stamps and FDC's. These stamps were issued in the prime "cachet" period for first day cover collectors as there was a large number of cachet makers offering their illustrated covers to the growing FDC market.

The third printing measures 14mm wide (missing only #7b, the 15c value to be complete) and the fourth printing measures 19mm wide (only two values with this overprint, #1c and #5c, the 1c and 10c values) All very short-lived provisionals, produced by the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian administration.

3408
364	Worldwide - Bankers box filled with Worldwide on-paper sorted into SIX small boxes, including more recent material (including Canadian souvenir sheets).

163
365	Worldwide - Bankers box jammed with thousands of stamps, with a good variety of both on and off paper. We immediately noticed Canadian and American material, but there is something from almost everywhere in here. A true "loose" mix, with only the occasional glassine, packet or baggie noticed.

Estimate =	$120.00	$70.00
6512
366	Worldwide - Bankers box of loose "on and off" paper, including Canada and US, but also a bit of something from almost everywhere.

6512
367	Worldwide - Box lot accumulation of 14 distinctly different albums or stockbooks, plus loose pages and loose stamps. Includes a couple of single country albums, but most is a mish-mash of miscellaneous material (almost all 20th century), from most corners of the world. Undoubtedly coming from a wide range of sources, this represents the remnants of an estate. There are thousands of stamps here, most of which has not been looked at for 40-plus years. Estimate is conservative at only $10.00 an album, ignoring all the loose material. Chase the winter blues away! Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6087

Usual mixed condition. Estimate =	$170.00	$100.00
6025
370	Worldwide - Collector's accumulation of unprocessed material. Every collector has that pile of stuff that they have acquired that is awaiting more material before processing or sits in limbo awaiting decision(s). This box is a very diverse group of that type of material, including stockbooks, album pages, lots of envelopes and loose stamps. No particular theme, just lots of interesting material to work through. If the stamps aren’t enough for you, there is also some ephemera/collectible material too including cigarette cards. Estimate =	$140.00	$95.00

371	Worldwide - Copy paper box filled with a cold winter’s worth of philatelic sorting! The box is half-filled with a good assortment of modern on-paper mix, from a range of countries, mostly separated by country. The other half of the box is made up of old-school approval packet material with interesting topical material, including some countries where approval packets were the only practical way to obtain their issues. The group is topped off with a bit of unsorted material and some loose album pages. For the soaker who likes to sort, or the sorter who likes to soak! Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
6154
372	Worldwide - Eastern Europe. A block from the bloc, represented in 7 albums and 1 folder. A grouping of auction lots, collector duplicates and a couple of albums totaling thousands upon thousands of stamps. Strength is in Russian/Soviet Union material which accounts for about 1/3 of this lot. There is also a good stock of Hungary, a stockbook of Czechoslovakia (and noticed a bit of later Slovakia), a couple thousand Romanian stamps, and a nice accumulation from East Germany (DDR). We noted some earlier issue with cancel potential and lots of sets (with much topical interest), with some duplication. A box to keep you warm this winter. Estimate =	$160.00	$75.00
6478
373	Worldwide - European Jacques in the box. Open it up and you don’t know what might spring out! A U-haul box of unloved auction lots, partial collections, club approval sheets and envelopes of loose. In no particular order we noted Belgium, Germany, Czechoslovakia (with a page of 1934 National Anthem), Poland (with a study of forgeries), Russia, France, Denmark, Sweden, Finland (and more!). A good span of time covered here, from the early issues up to about 1992. Thousands of stamps, including the unusual. Estimate =	$180.00	$120.00
5907
374	Worldwide - File box packed with loose "on and off" paper from all eras, and seemingly from everywhere that issued stamps. Very few glassines or packaging, this is almost all pure stamps. Received from an estate, we didn’t dig too deep into this, but it appears that at least half the volume of this box is off paper stamps. A sorting bonanza! Estimate =	$130.00	$60.00
6486
375	Worldwide - Four volumes of special "Presentation Collections" or "Prepared Collections". Including...1) "Royal International Gold Collection" with a total of over 90 First Day Covers with cachets that include a gold leaf replica of the stamp, mounted in a plastic sleeve and slipped into a page explaining the issue. A wide range of countries and topical themes, but in particular we noted flight, birds, flowers, famous people etc. All in a custom 3-ring binder with slip cases. 2) card "Flowers of the World" 100 card set issued by the "Royal Horticultural Society" (actually Franklin Mint), with each card with a single stamp and a matching cachet cancelled on the first day of issue. 3) "Great Historic Aircraft of the World" collection of 63 panels, each with a single mint stamp and technical diagram of the airplane and an writeup on back. 4) "Postal Commemorative Society" issued a large album to mount Charles and Diana Royal Wedding first day covers that were individually mailed to the subscriber (regular issues, no souvenir sheets). The original retail cost would have likely been around $2000.00. Estimate =	$150.00	$36.00
5979
376	Worldwide - Home Depot "small" sized box with a variety of "I" to "P" country collections. Includes Iran, Iraq, Italy, Poland, Portugal along with with some smaller countries, such as Malagasy, Malawi, Monaco, Mozambique, Latvia, Liberia and Lichtenstein (these on computer generated album pages). An assortment of mint and used, all eras, with some duplication. Varying degrees of completeness. A grand total of 8 volumes. Estimate =	$140.00	$70.00
6511
377	Worldwide - Latin America. A big black binder of Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Haiti on computer generated album pages, supplemented by an equally thick bundle of stock pages, album pages, envelopes and glassines (from those previously mentioned countries and more). Partly organized in some areas, chaotic in others, with potential finds hiding among the thousands of mint and used stamps in this offering. Estimate =	$140.00	$90.00
5495
378	Worldwide - Mixed group box-lot from around the globe. Roughly half of this lot is smaller sized albums and spring backs, all of which were abandoned after 1970 but left filled with stamps, including many interesting looking items. The balance of the lot includes a Statesman album with lots of "Dunes" and then a handful of loose stamps, stockcards or album pages with single country or topical interest. As always, there is no pattern to this box, but a range of Europe caught our eye with a respectable amount of South America and a touch of Asian material (mostly Japan). Estimate =	$160.00	$95.00
3732
379	Worldwide - Potato box loaded to the gunwales with a bit of everything. Noted albums, packets, stockpages, small boxes, approvals, partial collections, glassines and cards. No distinctly strong areas (we did notice about 1000 Turkish stamps), but there are thousands of stamps from across the world. Would make a great evening’s work at your stamp club or give you hours of pleasure during these shortened days. Estimate =	$160.00	$55.00
6486
380	Worldwide - Small box of philatelic wonders. A box about the size of two shoeboxes, filled with a wide array of stamps, postcards and covers. The lot starts with SIX older stockbooks filled with a varying degree of stamps and labelled Germany, South and Central America, Europe, Canada, Eastern Europe and Africa / Middle East. These are followed by a couple dozen postcards / covers, a 1980's Postal Commerative Society USA FDC prepared collection, some miscellaneous WW stamps in envelopes / pages and about US$75.00 Mint NH face-value USA on pages. Estimate =	$130.00	$38.00
5575
381	Worldwide - Swastika - Good and Evil. A fascinating 43-page exhibit with over 40 covers/cards and numerous stamps and/or postmarks with the Swastika symbol, going back to the early 20th century. Includes the period where a Swastika was a positive symbol, represented on greeting post cards and town cancels. There is the requisite period where the Nazi’s turned the world’s perspective on it, followed then a bit on its re-emergence on the swastika as a positive symbol again. Complete with the owner’s original research and additional material that was not mounted (such as a terrific cover with a full back map showing Swastika Ontario). Near impossible to duplicate. Estimate =	$180.00	$260.00
6216
382	Worldwide - Two boxes of philatelic mish-mash from all across the planet. Box ONE includes a binder of mostly Harris pages covering A-U countries, a sparsely populated Citation album from the early 1960’s and three shoeboxes filled with 102 cards / glassines (with a little bit of everything). Box TWO is 9 volumes including a dedicated binder of South Africa, a binder of United States and a bit of Channel Islands and the balance of volumes being binders or stockbooks with a wide range of material that does not fit into any specific category. This will make for interesting identifying and sorting. Thousands of stamps in total. Estimate =	$200.00	$80.00
6293
383	Worldwide - U-Haul Box of mini-collection accumulations, as received. A combination box lot, comprising of several small lots, not enough to stand on their own, but combining to make an enticing mixed offering. Includes (in no particular order)...1) Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Faroe Islands), sorted off paper and in glassines / "102" cards within small box (several hundred stamps in total). 2) Worldwide Perfins and Canadian Precancels, sorted into glassines / cards within a small box. 3) Shoebox of 1970's / 1980's Christmas Seals (still in original envelopes) and a smattering of "odds and ends" including labels and stationery cut squares. 4) Two older stockbooks, one containing USA, the other Worldwide. 5) Zambia used (off paper) sorted into envelopes. 6) San Marino sorted into envelopes / glassines (small box, mostly used). 7) Trinidad & Tobago / Gold Coast, several hundred mostly used sorted into envelopes. 8) Small box containing a collection (although more of an accumulation) of Airmail Labels (etiquettes). 9) Shoebox with Australia / USA on-paper mix (including more recent) and a bundle of British FDC. 10) Dozens of envelopes with a mix of Canada / Worldwide, sorted or semi-sorted into categories (such as WW mix / Canada / "Sand Dunes" etc). Lots of sorting ahead for the intrepid collector. Estimate =	$300.00	$130.00
6511
384	Worldwide - Unusual and seldom offered accumulation of 1980’s machine generated postage labels. A mixed group which includes Frama, Automat or any other number of issuing companies. Needless to say, these were overlooked, sometimes intentionally, by the philatelic world. Over time, there has been a greater appreciation for the scarcity of these issues and they are appearing more often in catalogues as people are realizing that they shouldn’t have thrown so much of this material in the recycling bin! This bankers box is packed with a worldwide accumulation of mint, used and on cover / card (both commercially and philatelically used). A good 300+ items, including (in no particular order) : Chile, Brazil, Germany, Netherlands, Israel, Singapore, Japan, Australia, France, Belgium, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lithuania, Portugal, Macau and many more. Includes three pocket-sized catalogues from the late 1980’s that were the first kick at codifying these items and a small stack of New Zealand (non-label) permit envelopes back to about 1940. A near-impossible lot to duplicate lot. Estimate =	$160.00	$75.00
3632
385	Worldwide - We had bear-ly opened this box of "on and off" paper with some packet material when we saw several used copies of Canada’s $8 Grizzly stamp. Buried in here is a box of worldwide stamps, sorted in envelope by country, then almost every other spot in this box is filled with stamps from all over, throughout the 20th century, up to about 2010. An interesting mix, being desk clean-up from an estate. We guarantee thousands of stamps inside! Estimate =	$120.00	$60.00
6154
386	Worldwide - Western Europe. Sturdy potato box with 13 albums, stock books, binders of stockpages, dealer stock and collector duplicates with a good range of single country collections. In no particular order we noted Belgium, Norway, Greece, Austria, Netherlands (2), Italy, Switzerland (2, including some covers), Lichtenstein and France (2). A good range of classics to the early Millenium and everywhere in between. Thousands of stamps in total, being both mint and used with duplication. Reasonably organized and good appearance. Lots of happy hunting awaits the successful bidder. Estimate =	$200.00	$110.00
4343
387	Worldwide - Winter is coming! Trio of U-haul boxes are packed with albums, stock books and loose pages which should keep you tied up for days! Includes leftovers from estates, or odds and ends accumulated over a period of time. We gave this a cursory look and it appeared like much of this material hasn’t seen the light of day for decades. There is no real theme here, but expect a range of material to keep you trotting across the philatelic world. Estimate =	$300.00	$240.00
6466
388	Worldwide / Europe - Year sets, presentation folders, booklets and stamp books from the 1970’s to 2008.

Lot finishes with two sets of "Top of the World" issues from Scandinavian countries, 6 assorted packs from Greenland plus a couple other incomplete booklets thrown in. Significant original cost with much of this material typically produced in very limited quantities. Estimate =	$140.00	$140.00
269
389	Worldwide Covers - Hoard of over 1000 covers and postcards, crammed into a "wine box" from across the globe. A nice mix of both commercial and philatelic mail, with almost no material from Canada (and only a small group of USA and Britain). We noted registered mail, airmail, rates, censors and first day covers (to name a few). In need of a good sort and easily worth the estimated value. Estimate =	$200.00	$220.00
5495
390	Worldwide Covers - Postal History filling a file box, most from modern correspondences. Most are loose or bundled, but there are a couple of albums of mounted GB covers (Machin rate covers, OHMS or Forces mail). There are covers in layers including Israel, Canada, USA, Australia and Europe, with the bottom of the box being a series of large parcel pieces sent from Japan to the United States. Most are 1980’s-2000 (give or take). Perhaps some potential finds here for the "modern" Postal Historian. Estimate =	$100.00	$110.00
6539
391	Worldwide Covers - Switzerland 1960's to 1980's accumulation of First Day Covers and Special Event covers. A total of 616 covers, neatly packed into a dealer show box. Lightly duplicated, but includes many better sets and singles including Europa, semi-postals and a great showing of Switzerland's colourful commemorative issues of the period. Conservatively estimated at less than 20c per item. Estimate =	$120.00	$70.00
5979
392	Worldwide Covers - Switzerland 1970's to 2000's accumulation of First Day Covers, Special Event covers and Flights. A total of 543 covers, packed into a dealer show box, being a hoard of a long-time collector of Swiss material. We noted many better stamps in the group, often in sets including higher-values and semi postals. A nice range of event covers, including a few foreign (France / UK). The stamps alone would have a significant catalogue value. Estimate =	$120.00	$70.00
5979
393	Worldwide Postcards - Christmas Greetings Collection. Assembly of 262 vintage pre-1920 postcards all with Christmas themes including many embossed cards.
