870
73	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$290.00

5233
85	Canada #BK277. DRAMATIC PANE SHIFT ERROR. VF condition, complete and intact 2003 issue 48c "Ice Skates" Christmas booklet of 12 with a dramatic printing shift resulting in the "8" of each of the "48" denominations being completely cut off on each stamp.

870
86	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps.

5233
87	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10.

The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$95.00

5492
92	Canada #1194Bf. FORGERY. Counterfeit imperforate full mint NH sheet of 110 of the 1990 issue 39c dark violet Flag coil. This fake was produced in Montreal back in the early 1990s with the intention of defrauding the post office but the ring was broken up by the RCMP before production was complete. A few sheets and strips of these forgeries ended up on the philatelic market a short while later. A modern Canadian faux-philatelic conversation piece! Estimate	$500.00	$48.00
4350
93	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH.

5233
95	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower left corner inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety block. 2018 Unitrade.	$950.00	$325.00
5614
96	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$250.00
870
97	Canada #1696a. VF MNH investment lot of eight full sheetlets of the 1998 issue 45c ATM stamp. This is the first of the two experimental panes (the Post Office also issued a 46c later in the year).

Total face value of all the stamps is $72.36 (plus a theoretical $2.50 for the postcard). Becoming an increasingly difficult group to assemble, let alone complete as comprehensively as this. All Unitrade listed as distinctly individual items. 2018 Unitrade.	$324.50	$90.00
1003
99	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00
870
100	Canada #BK5d. ENGLISH. Complete and intact pristine condition English language booklet with small type II text, containing two fresh and VF panes of the 2c carmine KGV Admiral (#106a).

4841
102	Canada #BK10b. The last Admiral booklet issue (December 1923), containing one pane of 4 plus 2 labels of each of the 1c yellow (105a), 2c green (107b) and 3c carmine (109a), all Fine centered. The interleaving has large cap slogans. The covers are unbent but have erased pencil notations. No premiums added. 2018 Unitrade.	$500.00	$75.00
5482
103	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$65.00
5233
104	Canada - Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Note that one booklet has horizontal bend. Estimate	$150.00	$85.00
3638

57	Canada #334. DRAMATIC MIS-PERF. Eye-catching mint NH upper right plate #1 plate block of the 1953 issue 50c light green "Textile Industry" with a DRAMATIC SHIFT of the horizontal perforations.

5178

5596
66	Canada #1250ii. Rare lower right position inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative. The vast majority of these stamps were recalled due to very poor printing quality. 2018 Unitrade.	$250.00	$85.00
5596
67	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find, especially when still in the original envelopes and with the special return post card as are these. 2018 Unitrade.	$400.00	$75.00
3725
68	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper right corner inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety block. 2018 Unitrade.	$950.00	$230.00
5631
69	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$260.00
5115
70	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

5445
71	Canada #1696a. VF MNH investment lot of ten full sheetlets of the 1998 issue 45c ATM stamp. This is the first of the two experimental panes (the Post Office also issued a 46c later in the year). The sheetlet is the exact same size as a Canadian banknote. A short lived experiment. Total face value of the panes is $81.00. Difficult sheets to acquire. 2018 Unitrade.	$350.00	$75.00
5596
72	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
5596
73	Canada #BK5f (English). Complete and intact pristine condition English language booklet with small type II text, containing two fresh and VF panes of the 2c carmine KGV Admiral (#106a), rate change overprint on cover.

3387
74	Canada #BK11, BK12 (ENGLISH). Two F/VF condition 1928 issue English text booklets containing 4 panes of six of the 1c orange KGV Scroll (#149a, BK11) or 2 panes of six of the 2c green KGV Scroll (#150a, BK12). All the panes are fresh and F/VF, with decent covers but no premiums added because of writing on one cover and slight wear on the other cover. 2018 Unitrade.	$325.00	$60.00
347
75	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
5725
76	Canada #C7, C8, C9, CE1-CE4, E10-E11, J15, J16, J16B, J17. Very nice quality mint selection of "Back of the Book" plate blocks, all neatly housed in a Lighthouse brand stockbook.

5329
79	Canada #FWH11b. The 1995 issue $8.50 "Redheads" Federal Wildlife Habitat Conservation Stamp in a full VF mint NH sheet of 16 with full marginal inscriptions. This is a much scarcer format than the more readily available booklet panes of one. Total face value $136.00. 2018 Unitrade.	$325.00	$42.00
5604
80	Canada #FWH25, FWH27-FWH35. VF mint NH complete run of Federal Wildlife Habitat Conservation stamp booklets from 2009 up to and including the latest issue from 2018.

5482
81	Canada #J1-J20. Complete mint run of all the 1906-1965 issue postage dues. All Fine or better, mostly Hinged or with glazed gum. This lot represents all the "purple" dues. Expect the odd small fault. 2019 Scott US$489.50=	$636.35	$70.00

82	Canada #MR1. Fresh and Fine MNH block of six of the 1c green 1915 issue KGV War Tax. 2019 Scott US$390.00=	$507.00	$55.00

83	Canada #O1/O49. F/VF mint (most VF) and almost all NH selection of 1949 to 1963 period OHMS and G overprinted Officials, all in blocks of four or larger as well as in plate blocks. All valued by Scott catalogue only. Upside potential for the plate blocks and VFNH stamps in the mix. Take a good look at the scans and the inventory list for a better idea of the composition and quality of this lot. 2019 Scott $565.35=	$734.96	$90.00
4197
84	Canada #O1-O8, O10-O49, O38a, O39a, O45a, CO1-CO2, EO1-EO2.

163

As of yet unlisted in Unitrade (but should be). Comes with a 2017 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which confirms the variety as well as the NH status and states "genuine in all respects".

Noted fluorescence levels properly identified according to the Keane/Hughes Centennial scale, Darnell-listed colour shift varieties and block of 6 with the "Missing bird on totem" variety (Unitrade #572ii). Here's a great opportunity to acquire a fully formed, extensively and dedicatedly researched comprehensive collection in choice mint NH condition. Significant total catalogue value with lots of potential upside. Ex-Mike Painter. Estimate	$350.00	$170.00
5435
63	Canada #715. DRAMATIC MIS-PERF. Two large mint NH portions of a unique and dramatically mis-perforated sheet of the 1978 issue 14c red Parliament definitive. An original and up until now unreported find from an Edmonton area post office. The mis-perf shifts correspond to the Unitrade illustrated valuations (2018 Unitrade page 27) of $20-$30 and $50-$60 per stamp, depending upon the degree of shift.

VF mint NH positional left hand sheet margin pair of the 1978 issue 12c Peregrine Falcon, with the left hand stamp (and a portion of the right hand stamp) showing the Unitrade listed Repellex error.

5614
65	Canada #950a. VF MNH vertical pair imperf between, 30c red Maple Leaf 1982 coil issue, with no trace of horizontal scoreline. Unlisted in Unitrade, with a completely imperf pair listed at $450.00. Estimate	$150.00	$46.00
5038
66	Canada #1039a. Three original mint NH pads of 100 of the 1984 issue $1.65 "Canadian Locomotives" souvenir sheet. These sheets are well-known to possess numerous Darnell catalogue listed varieties (such as "Double Brake-arm" and "Missing Date") and shades, as well as Unitrade listed tagging flaws. Total face value as postage is $495.00 but worth more for the varieties. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,200.00	$270.00
4239
67	Canada #1165c. VF mint NH example of the 1988 issue 38c "Parliament" definitive, printed on the gum side. Harder to find than the catalogue value would suggest. 2018 Unitrade.	$125.00	$42.00

68	Canada #1176a. VF MNH full sheet of 50, with inscription blocks, of the 1990 issue 63c Harbour Porpoise on Peterborough paper in the scarce perf 13.1 x 13.1.

4780

72	Canada #1442vi. VF MNH upper left plate of 4 of the 1992 "Canada in Space" issue with the scarce "Meteor Shower" variety on the holograms of both stamps in the second column.

5604
74	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00
3398
75	Canada #BK3c (English), BK5d (English).

Superb and pristine intact examples of both the French and English text types of the 1935 issue booklet containing 2 perfect VFNH panes of six of the 2c brown GeoV "Mufti" issue (#218b).

A very elusive group, especially the French text booklets. 2018 Unitrade.	$590.25	$130.00
5189
80	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
5648
81	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$95.00
5596
82	Canada #J13, J14. VF mint NH lower right corner blocks of four of the 4c and 10c values from the 1933-1934 "third" Postage Due issue. The #J13 is in a Plate #1 plate block. 2018 Unitrade.	$600.00	$110.00

VF mint (all NH except for the odd area of gum disturbance on a couple of the earlier issues), complete run of all the 1935 to 1978 issue "purple" and "red" postage dues, almost all in plate blocks. All the stamps have been valued as the least expensive paper types according to Unitrade. A comprehensive group and a great start to a complete set of Postage Dues. 2018 Unitrade.	$385.40	$42.00
4197
84	Canada #MR2a. VF MNH example of the scarce Unitrade listed rose carmine shade of the 1915 issue 2c KGV War Tax. A great little stamp. 2018 Unitrade.	$150.00	$70.00

Scarce modern material, overlooked by most collectors when issued. 2018 Unitrade.	$400.00	$220.00
5614

194	Worldwide - Stamp Miner Motherlode. Banker's box packed to the brim with a many year collection/accumulation of topically themed acquisitions, many still in the original sales sheets.

The topicals include Dogs, Sports, Disney, Birds, Butterflies, Ships and sundry. There is also a surprisingly decent quality, quantity and range of worldwide and Canada used on and off paper. Two albums containing used Canada collections round out the offering. This box needs to be processed layer by layer, which is how it came to us. A large table to lay out and group the wide range of material in this lot would also be a good idea. There will certainly be a few nuggets to be panned in this philatelic claim! Well worth the estimate if you are willing to do the work. Estimate	$150.00	$150.00

Actually the pair consists of two carefully trimmed stamps (#93 & 116), expertly pasted on a perforated blank Admiral era stamp paper (blank sheets of perforated Admiral issue paper stock are known).

4197
37	Canada #116. F/VF Post Office fresh, mint block of four of the 10c plum KGV Admiral. Pristine never hinged gum. A brilliantly intense shade of this, the key Admiral value. 2018 Scott US$2,700.00=	$3,375.00	$425.00
4347
38	Canada #120. Fresh and F/VF MNH block of four of the black brown 50c GeoV Admiral, dry printing. 2018 Scott US$900.00=	$1,125.00	$260.00

39	Canada #125-130. Complete mint set of 1912-1924 issue perf 8 (vertical) GeoV Admiral coils, all in strips of four. Note that the strip of #125 has thins and is not counted in the total. The strip of #126 is a paste-up and the group is generally in F/VF condition. While some stamps in the lot are NH, the entire group has been conservatively valued as Hinged. 2018 Scott US$728.00=	$910.00	$100.00

48	Canada #249/262. Nearly complete set of 11 different War Issue First Day Covers and 2 early usage covers, all addressed to and cancelled in Windsor, Ontario. Missing only the 3c rose violet to have all KGVI War Issues complete. A nice clean lot with the key $1.00 Destroyer FDC. Some values were only issued in Alberta on the day of issue, and so the 2 early usages may actually represent the day of issue in Windsor and the rest of southwest Ontario. Estimate	$200.00	$110.00
5614
49	Canada #334/586, BK46/BK74.

5709
50	Canada #456xx. Two VF MNH panes of 100 of the 3c dull purple Centennial issue with the warning strip either at left or right, precancelled with PVA gum and tagged GT2. Both panes show some reverse offset which is attractively doubled on the right pane. A great lot which would boost the quality and eye appeal of any Centennial exhibit. 2018 Unitrade.	$620.00	$160.00
5595
51	Canada #465pi. VF mint NH matched set of corner blocks of four of the 25c slate green Centennial, Winnipeg tagged, on HB paper with DEX gum. This is one of the scarcer Centennial varieties, nice to have as a matched set. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,000.00	$290.00
5595
52	Canada #705v. Full mint NH field stock sheet of 100 of the 1c "Bottle Gentian" definitive, all overprinted "HINTON/PEX/1977".

Note a constant overprint plate flaw at position #34 (HINTUN/PEX). The sheet has been lightly folded horizontally between rows 5 and 6. Full sheets are becoming exceedingly scarce. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,000.00	$160.00
5038
53	Canada #841a. Select quality VF+ mint NH example of the very rare 1979 Christmas Doll stamp, missing the "CANADA 35" gold text as well as the tagging.

5445
54	Canada #926A. VF selection of 100 VF mint NH examples of the short lived 1987 issue 36c plum QEII definitive, including three matched sets of blank corner blocks (these don't come with inscriptions). The October 1st issue definitive was delayed repeatedly (from May 6, 1987) due to production difficulties and not released until near the end of the 36c rate period. Thus, this value was current for just three months, during which time the 1987 Christmas stamps would have seen most of the usage. A clean and increasingly scarce investment group. 2017 Unitrade.	$448.00	$60.00
1683
55	Canada #977. VF mint NH matched set of inscription blocks of four of the 1983 issue $2.00 Commonwealth Day high value commemorative. Total face value $32.00. 2018 Unitrade.	$250.00	$48.00

VF MNH complete run of all the 1999-2000 Millennium miniature sheets including the basic set of 17 panes plus the additional six "Dove" thematic panes of 4 and 1 as well as the postal stationery post card. Total face value of all the stamps is $41.08. Becoming an increasingly difficult group to assemble, let alone complete. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$55.00
5233
57	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH. The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2018 Unitrade.	$161.00	$75.00
5526
58	Canada #2540i. VARIETY. The 2012 issue $2.00 Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee in a left margin strip of four, the error being on the lower stamp with imperforate bottom margin. VF mint never hinged. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,012.00	$325.00

3414
60	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$95.00
4301
61	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$120.00
269
62	Canada #F1-F3. Complete set of all three 1875 to 1888 issue 2c, 5c and 8c Registration stamps. The 2c orange and 5c green are OG Hinged. The 8c dull blue is lightly used, with a couple of stained perfs at bottom. 2018 Scott US$600.00=	$700.00	$70.00

5596
67	Canada #QW1-QW10 (FFQ #DQ1-DQ10). The first ten years of the Unitrade, Darnell and Van Dam catalogue listed Quebec Wildlife Habitat Conservation Stamps, all VF mint intact booklets. Each pane of one is a miniature work of wildlife art. The #QW1 is the hardest Quebec “Duck” stamp to acquire. 2018 Unitrade.	$305.00	$140.00
5482

VF condition quartet of Canada Post "yearbooks", consisting of the 1972 and 1973 books (the mint NH stamps from the books are on a stocksheet) as well as pristine examples of the rare 1975 and elusive 1975 books. The owner notes that the 1975 book contains the variety #670iii (waterline plate scratch). These books are listed in Unitrade as Annual Collections #12, 13, 14 and 15. 2018 Unitrade.	$372.50	$110.00

High quality modern mixes like this (includes stamps as recent as Kate and William Royal Wedding, Miss Supertest III Speedboat, Xmas 2011, Titanic, Selkirk, QEII Diamond Jubilee, Olympic, Famous Canadian issues, etc.) are becoming increasingly difficult to find. These lots are among our most popular bidboard offerings, always selling over the owner's conservative estimate of 10c per stamp. Estimate	$350.00	$110.00
1393

Clear partial strike of the extremely rare 1901 "PROVINCIAL EXHIBITION VICTORIA OCT 1 TO 5" slogan flag cancel (Coutts #P-785) on a pair of 2c QV "Numeral" issues. The full cancel has been very neatly reproduced to complete the "strike". This very early slogan is only known on a couple of dozen favour cancelled covers and on a handful of used stamps. It is theorized that this cancelling device was very annoying to use so the postal employees in the Victoria post office "misplaced" it after only a week or so of use. This is the "Holy Grail" of Canadian slogan/flag cancels. Coutts catalogue lists the value of this cancel on cover at $850.00. The lot comes with a photocopy of a very informative 1953 "Maple Leaves" article on the cancel by the well known Victoria stamp dealer, Reg Nairne. Estimate	$300.00	$42.00

16	Canada #35/47. Used "new to the market" monster lot of 4,251 used (a handful of mint also noted in the mix) Small Queen stamps (mostly #37/41) and 48 covers (mixed quality).

Sure to be finds for the student of this rich, fascinating and long running series. This lot represents the tip of a huge philatelic iceberg, much of it being seen for the first time in decades.

5038
75	Canada #1125Ai. VF mint NH 1987 CAPEX '87 $1.86 souvenir sheet, with the Unitrade listed "Black and green inscriptions doubled". An often overlooked variety as it requires a bit of magnification to become apparent. 2018 Unitrade.	$75.00	$16.00
4007
76	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH.

5595
77	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH example of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date.

3725

5456
81	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00

82	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly and dog thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. Look for sets to increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2018 Unitrade.	$160.00	$65.00
5233
83	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Normal sheet included for comparison. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. 2018 Unitrade.	$194.00	$180.00
5416
84	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
5233
85	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$180.00

All semi-sorted in #102 dealer cards, stored in two long red boxes. Didn't see any particularly valuable individual items but the lot, offered as received, could be a source of cancels and unrecognized/undiscovered tid-bits. Note that the collector was a smoker so you might want to air the lot out a bit upon receipt. Expect some faulty material to be included in the mix. Estimate	$150.00	$120.00
5633

The third volume is a combination of stockpages and 3-ring pages with stamps hinged on to them (1,508 stamps and 6 souvenir sheets, #1/2671 plus Back of the Book). Duplication to be expected as two of the collections are similar but this also represents a great opportunity to combine the better examples of duplicates into a very nice collection. Estimate	$400.00	$325.00
3408
141	Denmark #2/38, O9. Finland 10, 21.

150	Falkland Islands Dependencies #1L19-1L33. Richly fresh and VF mint NH sheet margin complete 1954 issue QEII long pictorial "Ship" set of fifteen. LH in the selvedge only, all the stamps are pristine NH. This is one of the nicest ship topical sets ever produced. 2018 Scott US$240.75=	$300.95	$130.00
870
151	France #14/331 plus some postage dues. Mint and used 1853-1937 collection on old quadrille pages (17 pages total). 568 stamps total, almost all different with a few possible varieties. Some faulty earlies not valued. A good starter collection and a nice way to upgrade and fill in the early section of an existing collection. 2018 Scott US$1,372.25=	$1,715.31	$85.00
3939
152	France #39c. Four margin mint no gum example of the 1870-1870 issue 2c chocolate on yellowish imperforate Bordeaux, the scarce type A. VF appearance, vertical crease. 2018 Scott US$750.00=	$937.50	$48.00

These issues only exist in precancelled form and are very scarce as dated corner blocks. Conservatively valued as four mint NH sets of singles only. 2018 Scott US$96.00=	$120.00	$85.00
4054
154	France and Colonies - Mixed condition mint and used lot as received, ranging from the early imperfs up to inexpensive modern material. A quick survey noted #9 (used faults), #37 (used faults) and #76 (mint no gum, faults). Take a good look at the stamps, all laid out on stocksheets, in order to appreciate the range, better items and relative quality of the material in the lot. Expect faults in a lot of this nature but sure to be useful finds for the fan of early French material. Estimate	$180.00	$60.00
4389
155	France and Colonies - Over 8,100 duplicated (sometimes heavily) mint and (mostly) used stamps, all contained in 1 album, 3 stockbooks and a half dozen envelopes. The material runs from early French imperfs up to modern CTOs. Includes France proper, French Africa and a smattering of other regions. Useful variety for the budding Francophile philatelist. Estimate	$160.00	$85.00
4389
156	Gambia - Oversize stockbook pages containing 172 different stamps (including shades - only duplication is between mint and used) and two mini-sheets. Fine used and MLH or better.

157	Germany - Federal Republic Used on Paper. Top quality mix of 3,000 used mostly 1980s to 2015 period issues. Noted lots of higher values and large format commemorative pictorials. Duplication to be expected, but a mix as nice and as modern as this is very hard to find. Conservatively valued at 10c per stamp. Estimate	$300.00	$85.00
3495
158	Germany - Post WWII Defaced Hitler Stamps. Mint Hinged lot of 25 different early post-war locally applied defacing handstamp overprints on "Hitler Head" definitives. One of the overprint types in this lot is identifiable as Schwarzenberg but due to the enormous number different types of provisional "defacers", the others will require some research. These come from an older collection and are all hinged but none the less sold "as is". Estimate	$150.00	$120.00
3780
159	Great Britain #27, 28, 29 (pl #7, 8, 9, 12), 30, 34, 43 (pl #7, 12, 13), 44. An even dozen sound, used 1856-1865 period Victorian era classics. Nicer general quality than we usually see. All different for Scott catalogue or plate number. 2017 Scott US$1,142.50=	$1,428.13	$110.00
5435
160	Great Britain #96, 108, 109, 309/2278, MH18/MH176. All used selection of high face value issues, with the bulk of the value in the three Victorian era stamps. The more modern issues are at times duplicated but include very useful and surprisingly elusive items. See the scan of the accurate inventory list for the full story. 2018 Scott US$1,217.65=	$1,522.06	$75.00
5483
161	Great Britain #173, 173a, 174, 174a, 179, 180, 181, 222, 223, 224. A herd of used GeoV Seahorses, consisting of 2sh6p, 5sh and (a couple of) 10sh values, identified as various printings and re-engravings, 1913 to 1934 period issues. Huge theoretical catalogue value and lots of cancel and potential variety interest but take into account the overall quality (generally nice but expect some faults) and possible mis-identification when formulating your bid. Still a very useful group. Consignor's Scott catalogue value US$9,770.00=	$12,212.50	$280.00
5658
162	Great Britain #268. Perfectly centered and amazingly fresh VF mint upper right corner block of four of the 1948 GeoVI/Queen Elizabeth £1.00 deep chalky blue Silver Wedding commemorative. All four stamps are pristine NH, Hinged in the selvedge only. This issue is the centerpiece of any GeoVI period collection. 2018 Scott US$160.00=	$200.00	$130.00
4425
163	Great Britain #BK144, MH22. VARIETY FDC. The scarce and elusive 1972 issue £1 "Wedgwood" Prestige booklet. In pristine and VF condition, with the key half-penny well centered and with good perfs all around. This is the first and rarest of the long running series of popular Prestige type booklets. As an even scarcer "added bonus" is the GPO First Day Cover franked with part panes, including the rare 1/2p (with full perfs!). 2018 Scott catalogue is US$150.00 for the VF mint booklet alone. A great Machin exhibition duo. Estimate	$120.00	$55.00
3638
164	Great Britain #O31-O32, O34-O37, O41, O67-O68, O73. Officials. Seven "Govt. Parcels" stamps, two Board of Education and one Admiralty (for a total of ten stamps). Fine used with full perfs, clean backs, and reasonable but the usual heavy-ish parcel cancellations on most of the parcels overprinted stamps. 2018 Scott US$612.00=	$765.00	$70.00
3266
165	Great Britain - 94 different recent used POUND values ONLY, mostly commemoratives, 2010-2016 issues, all postally used. These are hard to get nowadays with many British Post Offices no longer carrying high value stamps (now using meters only) and the big decline in postal usage. These used issues usually sell for more than catalogue value! 2018 Scott US$198.00=	$247.50	$120.00
163
166	Great Britain - Machin Regionals. Mostly mint (and mostly NH) and used selection of Machin portrait issues including mainly those for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales & Monmouthshire.

5435
167	Great Britain - QEII Wilding Issue Used Motherlode. Over 6,900 used QEII Wilding 1953-1958 series definitives, roughly sorted into glassine envelopes by denomination only. A great study lot for the collector with the patience to identify watermarks, papers and other varieties. See the owner's hand-written inventory list for quantities. Owner's estimate	$300.00	$10.00
4179
168	Great Britain and British Commonwealth - "Bigger than a Banker's Box" carton crammed with over 31,000 mostly used stamps from Great Britain (26,585 stamps) and sundry Commonwealth countries/colonies (5210 stamps). While there is a decent range of all types of material in the lot, expect significant duplication of some issues. All neatly but only arbitrarily sorted by Scott catalogue numbers or in dozens of envelopes awaiting sorting. The stamps are contained in 6 nice quality and condition Unisafe stockbooks, on Vario type pages in a couple of 3-ring binders and in dozens of envelopes. Did see a Penny Black in the mix and over £12.00 of mint GB face. I expect that there will be a few nuggets to be found after patient panning through the philatelic gravel. Estimate	$350.00	$260.00
5435

5397
172	Natal #49, 49a. Sound and Fine/VF examples of the 1875 issue 6p violet Victoria, with both the regular and INVERTED "POSTAGE" overprint. 2018 Scott US$200.00=	$250.00	$95.00

The consignor would like to point out that the first 5c in the earlies is a very interesting forgery. 2017 Scott US$425.70=	$532.13	$80.00
4521
176	Norway - 117 different very recent used 2010-2017 issues loaded with high values and sets. This new stuff is so hard to find now. F-VF. 2018 Scott $455.00=	$568.75	$55.00

As nice an offering of this surprisingly hard to find material as we have been able to offer in a long time with a huge total catalogue value. See the printed inventory sheet for more details.

5397
178	Russia - A grand accumulation! Many thousands (duplication) housed in 7 large binders with manila stock pages, 2 bound stockbooks, and a chocolate tin full of mostly mint sets and souvenir sheets. Mostly used stamps in the stockbooks are Scott number sorted, so a huge sorting job is already done for you! Some on album pages and saw lots of souvenir sheets in one of the binders. A big heavy lot but looks like a big bunch of fun for the Russia collector! Estimate	$300.00	$100.00
4389
179	South Africa - 900+ different used mounted collection on album pages in a binder, 1913-1968 issues on old Minkus pages, 1969-2000 on computer generated pages, and 2000-2014 sorted on two manilla stock pages.

4487
182	USA #83. Sound and Fine used example of the 3c rose Washington with "C" Grill (about 13 x 16 mm). Light pen cancel. Because these grills have the points up they are more difficult (but not impossible) to identify from the back than those with points down. A tough stamp to acquire and seldom offered. 2017 Scott US$1,100=	$1,375.00	$350.00
4054

A pretty little Victorian era group. 2018 Scott US$196.00=	$245.00	$120.00
3683
3	British Commonwealth - Commonwealth Royal Family Omnibus Quartet. Four different QEII/Charles and Diana commemorative omnibus series, each mounted in a special album. The lot consists of the 1953 Coronation issue (107 different, all mint Hinged), the 1977 Silver Jubilee (210 mint NH stamps, 7 booklets, 1 FDC and 1 aerogramme), the 1981 Charles and Diana Royal Wedding (230 mint NH stamps and 85 souvenir sheets) and another 1981 Charles and Diana Royal Wedding (414 stamps, all in mint NH gutter pairs).

4	British Commonwealth Literature - "Nearly new" condition Stanley Gibbons "COMMONWEALTH AND BRITISH EMPIRE STAMPS 1840-1970" catalogue, 2010 edition. This massively detailed and full colour tome covers all Commonwealth issues (including forerunners and provisionals) up to 1970, listing numerous varieties that are not recognized or priced in other publications. An absolute "must have" catalogue for the British Empire collector. Still very useful, as Gibbons catalogue values haven't changed much in recent years and the 1970 cut-off precludes the need to keep up with "new issue" listings. The Canadian retail price of the 2017 edition is over $250.00. The lot also includes a 2011 Unitrade Specialized catalogue for Canada and Provinces (retail value of the 2018 edition is $49.95). Estimate	$120.00	$55.00

The left hand stamp in the pair has the nearly full "(Raw)don, Wright, Hatch & Edson - New York." printer's inscription in the sheet margin at top (this stamp also has a small sealed tear at top). The pair of Beavers is tied to the front with two strikes of a "21" 4-ring target cancel in black. A great looking piece of early Canadian postal history (even without a back), valued as two used stamps only. 2018 Scott US$450.00=	$562.50	$500.00
5516

5112
9	Canada #14, 15, 17-20 plus Shades. Basic used set of 1859-1864 "First Cents" issues (no #16 of course) plus a couple of extra shades thrown in for good measure. A decent looking group. Expect the odd fault. 2018 Scott US$1,197.50=	$1,496.88	$110.00
4197
10	Canada #14/103, 135. All used collection of 1859 to 1908 (plus one 1917 issue) period Queen Victoria and EdwardVII issues, all hinged on computer generated 3-ring album pages. Very mixed condition (lots of small faults) but noted complete basic Large Queens, Small Queens and Edwards, including a 1908 Quebec Tercentenary set. See the scans to review the range as well as overall quality and take the condition into account when bidding. 2018 Scott US$4,210.00=	$5,262.50	$290.00

5112
14	Canada #21/46. Very mixed condition mint OG H/HR/no gum selection of 17 lightly duplicated Large and Small Queens. Two stamps with more prominent problems (#24 has a tear and #45 has a repaired corner) have not been counted in the total. The other stamps in the lot are generally sound but will have gum issues. Still a good start to these popular Victorian era classics. 2018 Scott US$2,982.50=	$3,728.13	$110.00
3434
15	Canada #22, 22b, 22i, 22ii. Faulty but very useful extensively researched and cross referenced and identified group of 1c brown red Large Queens. 20 single stamps and one pair, each stamp accompanied by a detailed notation as to paper, perf and condition.

3634
16	Canada #22i/29b. Very decent looking (but all faulty to some degree) study lot of 15 used Large Queen issues. All further identified by a very knowledgeable collector for perfs, Duckworth, Firth and Shoemaker paper types. Faults range from light creases to tears and thins. The 2c value is not counted in the total. All catalogued by Scott values only. (Unitrade will be more detailed). A great lot for the Large Queen student. 2018 Scott US$1,765.00=	$2,206.25	$65.00

1956
20	Canada #27, 27a. Used sextet of 6c Large Queens, all with legible dated CDS cancels. The knowledgeable consignor has further described them for papers and perfs. A great group for the "calendar" collector. 2018 Scott US$750.00=	$937.50	$120.00
5687
21	Canada #28, 28i, 28v. Very decent quality used group of 27 examples of the 12.5c blue Large Queen.

5435
22	Canada #36viii. Exceptionally clear and "clear of cancel" example of the Unitrade listed "latent re-entry,position 188 (Ottawa)", showing strong horizontal lines in the Upper Left margin. A rare constant engraved variety and on a VF stamp to boot! 2018 Unitrade.	$650.00	$400.00

Halifax transit and Yarmouth receiver cancels on reverse. Most bisects we see of the 6c originate in Nova Scotia from this time period. Poor supply logistics from the Post Office? 2018 Scott US$4,500.00=	$5,625.00	$1,125.00
4278
24	Canada #40. Fresh and Fine centered mint full OG H (slightly disturbed gum) example of the 1877 issue dull rose lilac 10c Small Queen. This is the basic shade of the early 10c Small Queen printing. 2018 Scott US$1,600.00=	$2,000.00	$210.00
5630
25	Canada #41vi. Sound and Fine CDS (JU/7/93) used example of the rare "vampire bite" plate flaw on the 3c vermilion Small Queen. The paper is the later, near newsprint stock and the "bites" are as strong examples as I have seen. 2018 Unitrade.	$150.00	$260.00
4247
26	Canada #44. SHADES. Mint accumulation of twelve 8c Small Queens, many with decent appearance but wth faults (thins, creases, etc.). A high catalogue value dozen! 2018 Scott US$3,120.00=	$3,900.00	$65.00
3976

1356
28	Canada #46, 47. Fresh and F/VF Mint Hinged examples of the 1893 issue 20c vermilion and 50c deep blue Queen Victoria "Widow's Weeds" high values.

5630
29	Canada #50-54. Fresh and F/VF MNH quintet of low value 1897 Queen Victoria Jubilee issues, all with pristine NH OG and bright colours. A great start to a mint NH set. 2018 Scott US$697.50=	$871.88	$210.00

4197
31	Canada #56. Fresh and VF mint VVLH example of the 1897 issue 8c dark violet QV Jubilee issue. It took me quite some time to find the Hinge mark (it's at the lower right corner - the stamp came from a mint block). Choice centering and vibrant deep shade. Unitrade is $200.00 for VF mint H. 2018 Scott US$130.00=	$162.50	$150.00
4993
32	Canada #58, 59, 60. Trio of brilliantly fresh, F/VF OG LH/H mid-values from the 1897 Queen Victoria Jubilee set, consisting of the 15c steel blue, 20c vermilion and 50c ultramarine values. 2018 Scott US$925.00=	$1,156.25	$130.00
4197

4453
34	Canada #61. Fresh and VF appearing Jumbo margin mint Hinged example of the 1897 issue $1.00 lake 1897 Jubilee. Small thin at bottom noted for the record. Even so, a nice looking start to the high value Jubilees. 2018 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,250.00	$150.00
5630
35	Canada #63. Fresh and Fine mint OG HR (large adhesion) example of the $3.00 bistre 1897 Queen Victoria Jubilee issue high value. Many collectors consider the $3.00 to be the key Jubilee value. 2018 Scott US$1,400.00=	$1,750.00	$210.00
5630
36	Canada #65. Sound and Fine mint OG HR example of the $5.00 olive green high value 1897 Queen Victoria Jubilee issue. Great colour, a very attractive top end to the set. 2018 Scott US$1,500.00=	$1,875.00	$475.00
1356

5504
42	Canada #96-103. Complete 1908 issue Quebec Tercentenary set of 8 in sound and F/VF mint condition. A fresh and generally well centered set. The ½c and 2c values are NH. The balance of the set is OH Hinged. A nicer than usual quality set. 2018 Scott US$1,069.00=	$1,336.25	$130.00
5233
43	Canada #96i, 96. Eye-catching trio of 1908 issue ½c black brown "Prince and Princess of Wales" stamps from the Quebec Tercentenary series, consisting of a perfect MNH example of the Unitrade listed MAJOR RE-ENTRY (position 44), a perfect MNH example of a normal stamp and a rare CDS used IN PERIOD block of 8. The items will be a welcome addition to any Quebec Tercentenary or Edwardian era collection. 2018 Unitrade.	$249.00	$130.00
4791
44	Canada #104, 108, 110, 112, 112a.

4197
45	Canada #104/2494 plus Back of the Book. A full century's worth of high quality, all used GeoV, GeoVI and QEII era collection of thousands of different 1911 to 2011 period issues, all neatly mounted on computer generated 3-ring album pages. The lot includes the GeoV Admirals and all the long pictorial sets up to the $1.00 high value, a decent range of Back of the Book issues, modern souvenir sheets, and recent high value commemoratives. This is the perfect lot for the collector wanting to upgrade or "flesh out" their used Canadian material. Estimate	$300.00	$95.00
3434
46	Canada #104/267, MR1-MR7. Mint and used balance of a large specialized Canadian collection, consisting of 234 stamps, 1911 to 1943 GeoV and GeoVI period issues. All valued as basic Scott catalogue types, even though a wide range of Unitrade listed varieties are present in the lot. A sampling of the noted items includes extended moustaches, Cockeyed King line pairs and strips, re-entries (on #162-163), Broken "E", Broken "X", line pairs, a Scarface, plus other Unitrade listed varieties. Expect the odd fault. 2018 Scott 2,389.15=	$2,986.44	$350.00
5471
47	Canada #104-122. Fresh and generally F-VF mint H/NH complete basic set of 18 of the 1911-1925 issue Geo V Admirals. Includes a good number of nice VF stamps in the group. The #108, 109, 112 and 120 are NH, the balance are OG H, HR or (a few) disturbed gum. A better than good starter set of these 20th Century classics. 2018 Scott US$1,435.00=	$1,793.75	$180.00
5197
48	Canada #119. SHADES. Mint quartet of 20c olive/sage/grey green GeoV Admirals, all Hinged or with redistributed/questionable gum. A good study group, as each stamp is a distinctly different shade. Valued as basic Scott types. 2018 Scott US$440.00=	$550.00	$75.00
5284
49	Canada #143. Upper left position plate #A-3 plate block of 6 of the 1927 issue 3c brown carmine Parliament Buildings commemorative from the Confederation Anniverary set. Fresh and VF MNH.

5471
50	Canada #162-177. Top-notch complete set of 16 of the 1930 to 1931 GeoV "Arch/Leaf" series with additional rotary printing of the 5c violet and dull blue shade of the other 5c. Loaded with VF stamps! The 4c and the first 5c blue have glazed gum but the rest are all lovely MNH. 2018 Scott US$1,068.50=	$1,335.63	$210.00
5402
51	Canada #195-243, 245-275, 278-281, 284-300, 302, 305-306, 309-315, 321, 331-334, 465B (MNH and used), 1568-1569. Superior quality selection of Canadian stamps on four Hagner brand stockpages, 1932-1995 MH/MNH issues. The lot consists of almost a complete run between #195/302 (1932-1951) and then scattered modern issues beyond that. Only one of the #465B is used, the rest mostly MNH. Mint hinged material comprises #196-201, 209 and 232, with the rest of the mint all sound, fresh and F/VF mint NH. Some nice added bonuses include coil pairs, some plate blocks, the aniline variety of the Chateau Ramezay and a margin block of four of #315 with a Unitrade listed cracked plate. This useful lot contains almost all complete sets. A lovely clean selection with loads of added value. Conservatively valued by Scott catalogue. Take a good look at the scans to appreciate the quality. 2018 Scott US$2,098.05=	$2,622.56	$270.00
2050
52	Canada #241-245, 241a. VF mint NH/H set of 1938 KGVI Pictorial Issue in pairs (#242-245) and blocks of 4 (#241, 241a). A couple minor faults noted for accuracy including small gum thin on one #241a and corner gum soak on one #245, still a group with fresh colours and great eye appeal. Unitrade catalogue is $702.50 for a group of this quality. 2018 Scott US$424.00=	$530.00	$70.00
4197
53	Canada #337p-341p. Comprehensive collection/study of Canada's first Winnipeg Tagged issue, the 1c to 5c Wilding definitives. The collection consists of a complete mint NH set in singles, blocks of four and matched sets of corner blocks/plate blocks (note plate #1 and plate #2 of the 3c value). There is also a used set of blocks, all with Winnipeg First Day cancels. The cacheted group of First Day Covers consists of a set of singles on one cover, sets of singles and blocks of four on individual covers and a complete set of matched sets of corner blocks (one block per cover). These groups were prepared and marketed by Kasimir Bileski back in 1963. Intact groups are becoming hard to find. Estimate	$200.00	$65.00
5055
54	Canada #343/915, B4/B10, J28/J40. Diverse and useful mixed NH and H collection of plate blocks, 1954 to 1982 era, in a battered old red Simplex springback album. All mounted on mixed styles of quadrille pages. The material is virtually entirely in matched sets with better items, both regular and "Back of the Book" noted throughout and face values up to $1.25. Conservatively valued for the useable face value postage contained in the collection but worth more. Face value	$244.44	$130.00
5624
55	Canada #420i/1277i. Clean and diverse, carefully identified VF mint NH, sometimes duplicated, selection/stock/accumulation of Unitrade listed paper, plate and printing varieties. All are in inscription or corner blocks, housed in dealer #102 stock cards. A great lot for the student of modern Canadian varieties, with some useful "extras" for future trade. See the scan of the very detailed spreadsheet using the Unitrade numbering system. Total face value of the lot is $72.84 but is worth many multiples of this amount. 2018 Unitrade.	$2,354.00	$190.00
4841
56	Canada #488/653. Christmas Collections. Remarkably comprehensive collections of all the possible permutations of the Christmas issues for 1968 (#488, 489, 488p, 489p, 488a, 488ai, 488q, 488qi), 1969 (#502, 502p, 502a, 502ai, 502q, 502qi, 503, 503p), 1970 (#519-528 with too many permutations to list!), 1973 (#625-628) and 1974 (#650-653). The collections (mainly prepared by Kasimir Bileski) include mint and used singles, regular and tagged issues, matched sets of plate blocks, booklet panes and cacheted First Day covers. Of particular note and constituting the bulk of the value of this lot is the 1970 Childrens' Drawings series. This group includes CDS First Day cancelled examples of the 5c and 6c identical centre blocks, both regular and Winnipeg tagged. The 5c blocks are both "M.A" types but the tagged 6c block is WITHOUT the "scratch through window" variety (much scarcer thus and worth a premium). All in all, a valuable and attractive holding. Estimate	$500.00	$120.00
2050
57	Canada #508-511, 508i 509i, 511i. Complete field stock (no plate inscriptions) sheet of fifty of the se-tenant 25c Osaka 1970 EXPO issue. VF MNH. Counted as 8 se-tenant blocks of four, two identical strips of three (#509i, #511i), an identical pair (#508i) and 10 singles. 2018 Unitrade.	$176.50	$42.00
5444
58	Canada #522i, 525i, 522pi, 525pi. VF mint "complete set" of all four types of the 5c and 6c identical centre blocks of four of the 1970 Christmas issue. The regular blocks have lightly glazed gum but the tagged blocks have perfect and unblemished NH gum. Of particular note is the fact that the #525pi block does NOT have the "scratch through window variety" and as such is much scarcer (warranting a 50% premium as per Unitrade footnotes). 2018 Unitrade.	$580.00	$95.00
3398
59	Canada #522pi. VF MNH identical centre block of four of the 5c "Children Skiing" 1970 Christmas issue, with Winnipeg phosphor tagging. The block has additional se-tenant stamps surrounding it (valued as the block of 4 only) and has the "dot between M and A" variety. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$55.00
5321
60	Canada #572ii. Scarce VF MNH full "field stock" pane of 50 of the 1974 issue 8c Pacific Coast Indians (with blank corners, as always found), showing the "missing bird on the totem" error at position 28 (the middle stamp in the right half pane of 25). A superb positional showpiece of a popular modern error. 2018 Unitrade.	$268.00	$120.00
4780
61	Canada #929i, 929. VF mint NH matched set of plate blocks of the Unitrade listed "brown background" variety of the 1983 issue 48c "Cradle" medium-value definitive. Previously thought to be a magenta missing colour error, the colour variety is actually due to an anomaly in the ink used by the printer. A very distinctive error of colour. The lot also includes one VF mint NH plate block the true colour for conclusive comparison. 2018 Unitrade.	$1,001.00	$400.00

62	Canada #1396. TAGGING ERROR. Mint NH strip of four of the 45c blue green "Flag" coil, all the stamps 3-Bar Tagged (G4aT). Note that the strip is also printed on Hibrite paper. A scarce modern tagging error. Del Peters catalogue.	$200.00	$44.00
4841
63	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower right position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety inscription block. 2018 Unitrade.	$950.00	$270.00
5389
64	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2018 Unitrade.	$800.00	$425.00
5690
65	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. Priced as four singles. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$110.00
5389

5233
67	Canada #C1/C9, CE1/CE3, E3/E11. Superior quality used (almost all F/VF and "Sock on the Nose" CDS cancelled) duplicated stock/selection of 1927 to 1946 period Back of the Book issues. 82 stamps in total. Conservatively valued by 2014 Scott catalogue but there is excellent upside potential if revalued by an up to date Unitrade catalogue. 2014 Scott US$167.90=	$209.88	$26.00
1
68	Canada #C2. Fresh and perfectly centered VF mint 3 NH/1 LH block of four of the 1930 issue 5c olive brown Mercury airmail. A beautiful multiple of the key Canadian airmail. Unitrade is $560.00 for a block of this quality. 2018 Scott US$395.00=	$493.75	$95.00

69	Canada #CL3, CL4. Two different fresh and VF condition mint Laurentide Air Service issues (4th and 5th issues), consisting of the "CANADA 1924 added" types of the (25c) red, perf 11.8 x 11.8 (#CL3, NH) and rouletted at top (#CL4, Hinged). Low printing numbers (#CL3 - 3,000 printed; #CL4 - 2,100 printed). These are among the first private commercial semi-official airmails. 2018 Unitrade.	$425.00	$150.00
4096
70	Canada #CL5. VF mint NH sheet margin example of the 1925 issue 25c blue Northern Air Service semi-official airmail stamp. Only 4,000 printed. 2018 Unitrade.	$262.50	$100.00

71	Canada #CL6, CL7, CL8, CL9, CL10, CL11, CL12. VF mint selection of seven different Jack V. Elliot, Elliot-Fairchild and Fairchild semi-official airmail issues. Very limited numbers printed (for example #CL6 - 2,504 printed; #CL7 - 2,000 printed; #CL10 - 2,000 printed; #CL11 - 5,000 printed; #CL12 - 5,000 printed). The NH stamps in this group are #CL6, CL7, CL8 and CL9. The other three are OG Hinged. A nice group of semi-official "earlies". 2018 Unitrade.	$560.00	$150.00
3552
72	Canada #CLP5. The $1.00 black on red paper 1924 issue Estevan-Winnipeg promotional semi-official airmail. Mint no gum, with faults but still a key early semi-official airmail issue. Only 1,028 examples of this stamp printed. 2018 Unitrade.	$400.00	$48.00
386
73	Canada #CP19-CP38, CP21ii, CP26ii, CP31ii, CP36ii. Post Office Fresh MNH set of Computer Vended Postage 'kiosk' stamp panes of 5 different designs, of all four denominations (Permanent, $1.20, $1.80 and $2.50), all with the short-lived 18-digit code and with the scarce Unitrade listed partial "11" at bottom left on each Tom Thomson design stamp. Strips dated this early can only have come from Vancouver and have the post office code 105341 at the beginning of the digit string. The partial "11" feature was apparently printed on the first strip in an order, and since most orders were rather large these strips are particularly scarce. These particular panes represent the key Unitrade-listed varieties from this issue. In my opinion, these panes are undervalued in Unitrade and should jump in value in the next edition. 2018 Unitrade.	$225.00	$190.00
5416
74	Canada #E1-E11, EO1-EO2. Select quality used run of all the 1898 to 1950 period Special Delivery and Official Special Delivery issues, all exceptionally well centered and all with light CDS cancels.

5536
76	Canada #E8. Fresh and VF mint NH block of four of the 1938 issue 20c dark carmine Special Delivery stamp. Unitrade is $350.00 for four VF mint NH singles. 2018 Scott US$200.00=	$250.00	$70.00

This last issue is distinguishable from earlier printings due to the imprints being at the sides of the blocks. 2018 Unitrade.	$135.00	$22.00
5342
81	Canada #MR4, MR5. Fresh and F/VF mint NH examples of two 1916 issue KGV War Tax stamps, consisting of the 2c + 1c brown (Die II) and the 2c +1c carmine, perf 12 x 8. An attractive duo of Admiral period items. 2018 Scott US$202.50=	$253.13	$42.00

83	Canada #O10, O273. VF used examples of the 1946 "Peace" issue $1.00 Ferry, one with OHMS 4-hole OHMS official perfin, the other with OHMS official overprint in black. A used #O10 is much harder to find than you would expect. 2018 Unitrade.	$105.00	$24.00

3534
128	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #17, 20. Fresh, sound and VF mint examples of the 2p and 6p rose imperf 1861-1862 pence issues, both on thin paper (no mesh). An excellent start to Newfie pence. These will catalogue higher in the Unitrade catalogue. The #17 is no gum, the #20 is NH. 2018 Scott US$197.50=	$246.88	$120.00
4096
129	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #18, 19, 20, 23. Scarce used quartet (mint is MUCH easier to find) of the last printing (1861-1862) decimal issues, consisting of the 4p rose, 5p reddish brown, 6p rose and 1sh rose. The #23 is a tad faded with tight to touching margins but the others are all VF four margin stamps. A very tough group to assemble. 2018 Scott US$460.00=	$575.00	$110.00

4096
131	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #34/270 plus some Back of the Book. Duplicated mint and used stock of over 850 stamps, 1870s to 1940s period issues. All neatly organized on Vario style stockpages. Expect some faults in a large lot of this nature but all the stamps have been conservatively valued as basic Scott catalogue types and the mint have all been valued as Hinged. Thus, there's a decent "upside" possibility for shades, varieties and NH stamps. 2018 Scott US$2,377.40=	$2,971.75	$220.00
4197
132	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #46, 47, 48. Fresh and F/VF mint trio of all the shades of the 1880 to 1896 issue 2c Codfish.

4780
135	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C3. Perfectly centered, VF used example of the 1921 issue 35c "Halifax Airmail". Neat usual wavy machine cancel. Of particular note on this stamp is an as of yet unlisted "Broken M in MAIL" variety in the overprint. Unitrade is $250.00 for a "normal" VF used #C3. 2018 Scott US$190.00=	$237.50	$130.00
5584
136	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C9-C11. VF mint hinged set of the 1931 Airmail issue, on watermarked paper. All exceptionally well centered. The 15c and 50c are pristine NH, the $1.00 value is OG LH. 2018 Unitrade.	$260.00	$70.00

Each stamp has a small paper fault, invisible from the front (small thins). An excellent looking duo which should suffice quite nicely until you can upgrade to sound material (the faults are so minor you might not feel the need to). 2018 Scott US$3,100.00=	$3,875.00	$325.00
5342
139	China - PRC #8L12-8L13. VF mint (no gum as issued) blocks of 20 of the $20.00 on 2c orange and $50.00 on 4c blue green provisional surcharges on the "Kweichow People's Post" overprinted issues for Southwest China. Rare early PRC locals. 2018 Scott US$280.00=	$350.00	$55.00

A quick examination of the lot revealed a good number of better complete sets, including NH PRC, as well as a good range of useful older mint and used issues from all areas of Chinese philately. This lot represents a great opportunity to find "hidden gems" as it is a multi-decade accumulation from one collector and first time on the resale market. Estimate	$800.00	$350.00
2271

5397
148	German States - Bavaria #2/14. Small collection of 56 early pre-Confederation Bavarian imperfs, 1850s to early 1860s period issues.

Owner's 2017 Scott US$1,266.00=	$1,582.50	$150.00

Highlights include a used Penny Black, mint and used ½p "Bantams" and a very decent range of useful stamps, including sets, multiples and "Back of the Book" material.

Estimate	$500.00	$450.00
1837
151	Great Britain #2. Sound and Fine used example of the 1840 issue 2p blue imperf. Clear Maltese Cross cancel in black. Much scarcer than the more famous "Penny Black". Unchecked for the plate number. 2018 Scott US$700.00=	$875.00	$70.00
3939
152	Great Britain #3/62. Mixed condition, all used selection of 220 stamps, 1841 to 1873 period issues. Of particular interest in the lot are the 140 x #33 (perforated "Penny Reds"), unchecked for plate numbers and valued at the low basic US$2.75 each. Expect some faults, as to be expected in an "as received" lot such as this. Rule Britannia and get out your loupe.

386
155	Great Britain #33. Mostly used selection of 140 1864 issue perforated "Penny Reds" all hinged on Stanley Gibbons album pages. They appear to be properly placed but I couldn't check them all.

5197
161	Great Britain - Mostly Machin Collection. Mint and used collection of 466 stamps, 2 booklet panes and 1 souvenir sheet, mostly laid out on Hagner brand stocksheets.

Includes complete commemorative sets, Wildings, Machins, Castles, phosphors, graphites, regionals and other Back of the Book type items. The stamps appear to have been properly placed on the pages, but I haven't checked for the accuracy of specific watermarks or verified the tagging. A great starter lot for the UK QEII collector. Estimate	$250.00	$130.00
3121
163	Great Britain - Royal Mail 1985 Post Office Yearbook. VF condition hardcover and slipcased annual collection of all the "special" (commemorative) stamp issues of 1985.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$110.00
4005
96	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. Estimate	$150.00	$260.00

According to both Unitrade and Van Dam, this is the second best artist signed booklet (after the Bateman signed #FWH1d).

4282
31	Canada #41-47. Mint group of 1888-1897 period Small Queens, with four distinct shades of the 8c value and three examples of the 50c deep blue Widow Weeds high value. One 50c is with no gum, the balance of the lot is with varying degrees of OG. No VF stamps in this lot but a generally still a high quality offering of the later printings. 2018 Scott US$4,570.00=	$5,712.50	$200.00
5614
32	Canada #42, 43, 44, 45. Mint OG HR quartet of later printing Small Queens. A decent looking group but the 10c value has thins.

Generally F-VF mint hinged (a few disturbed gum or no gum) selection of 43 almost all different 1897 to 1939 period issues, all on one Hagner stocksheet. The only duplication is for a few better 10c and 20c Admirals. Expect the odd small fault but still an attractive and useful group. 2018 Scott US$2,919.90=	$3,649.88	$190.00
4197
49	Canada #74-88 plus Varieties. The Queen Victoria "Numeral" set, including varieties, plus #85 and 86 in the four major shades, as well as #87 and 88. The owner notes that these are all in much better than average sound, used condition. The lot includes the Unitrade catalogue listed #74i, 75ii, 76ii, 77a and 77bs, 79b, 83i. The Scott numbered varieties include #76a. All conservatively valued as Scott types only. 2017 Scott US$371.35=	$464.20	$60.00
5567
50	Canada #76. Selection of 7 used varieties including 76ii (violet on thick yellowish paper), 76iii (major re-entry), 76iv (C-Flaw), a copy with strong doubling of numbers, two cents, and 'A POS', and two scarce, clear offsets of different shades of aniline ink. Estimate	$200.00	$65.00
5567
51	Canada #77b. Fresh, sound and VF mint OG VLH example of the extremely rare booklet pane of six of the 1899 issue 2c carmine QV "Numeral" (Die II). Canada's first booklet pane. This pane is in much nicer shape than what we usually see, and we don't see this pane very often. 2018 Scott US$1,600.00=	$2,000.00	$725.00
5614
52	Canada #87i. Fresh and Fine, pristine mint NH sheet margin strip of four of the 1899 issue "2 CENTS" surcharge on 3c carmine "Leaf", the two right hand stamps showing the Unitrade listed "narrow spacing" variety. Valued by Scott as four regular NH stamps. 2018 Scott US$180.00=	$225.00	$85.00

3590
56	Canada #96-103. The complete eight stamp set for the Quebec Tercentenary of 1908, all in sound, used condition. 2017 Scott US$694.00=	$867.50	$160.00
4197
57	Canada #101. Fat margin, perfectly centered VF mint LH example of the 1908 issue 10c dark violet "View of Quebec 1700" from the Quebec Tercentenary set. Unitrade is $300.00 for VF MH. As nice a mint stamp as you'll see without paying triple for NH gum. 2018 Scott US$200.00=	$250.00	$75.00
5644
58	Canada #104, 105, 107-111, 113, 114, 115, 119, 120. One dozen fresh and F/VF mint H/HR GeoV Admirals. All are sound and attractive but several have large Hinge remnants or disturbed gum. 2018 Scott US$676.50=	$845.63	$42.00

Over 200 mostly different mint 1912 to 1950s period stamps (plus a smattering of more modern items) on "Unity" album pages and Hagner stocksheets. **NOTE - Unity album pages are printed in colour. View carefully as the illustrations closely resemble actual stamps. All catalogued as hinged even though there was a good quantity of NH noted. Includes numerous complete sets including coils, imperfs, long pictorial sets to the $1.00 value and Back of the Book material. Some faults to be expected but lots of upside when the NH is valued. Owner's older 2012 Scott US$3,528.75=	$4,410.94	$140.00
5397
60	Canada #106a, 107 (x 4), 110, 115, 123 (x 3). Mint NH selection of GeoV Admirals, including better singles, booklet panes and coils. 2018 Scott US$1,377.50=	$1,721.88	$85.00

5389
63	Canada #122. Fresh and F/VF mint NH example of the 1925 issue $1.00 orange high value GeoV Admiral, dry printing. 2018 Scott US$240.00=	$300.00	$65.00

64	Canada #124/240. Generally F/VF mint H/NH 1912 to 1937 issue GeoV and GeoVI period collection consisting of Admiral coils and imperfs as well as a comprehensive run of coils (no 123 or 160-161 but otherwise complete to 1937), all laid out on Lighthouse brand hingeless album pages. High quality material and numerous complete sets noted throughout. All the mint has been valued as Hinged even though NH material was noted. 2018 Scott $600.00=	$750.00	$160.00
5471
65	Canada #129. VF MNH pair of the 3c brown (perf 8 vertical) Admiral coil. Unitrade for a VF MNH pair is $250.00. 2018 Scott US$120.00=	$150.00	$75.00
5614
66	Canada #141/230. Parallel mint H/NH and used selection of 1927 to 1935 GeoV period issues, all complete sets. While there will be the odd fault in the mix, there are some very nice VF items here and all of the mint has been valued as Hinged only even though a good amount of NH items were noted. 2018 Scott US$1,800.90=	$2,251.13	$130.00
5233
67	Canada #149-156. Fresh and VF MNH 1c to 12c values from the 1928-1929 KGV Scroll set. A nice start to a NH set as you can expect to acquire. Unitrade is $466.00 for the VF MNH part set. 2018 Scott US$295.00=	$368.75	$85.00
5233
68	Canada #158. Fine centered OG mint HR example of the 1929 issue 50c Bluenose. No Canadian collection is complete without one of these world-famous high value pictorials. 2018 Scott US$225.00=	$281.25	$46.00
5648
69	Canada #159. Fresh and F/VF mint NH example of the 1929 issue $1.00 olive green Parliament high value from the GeoV Scroll set. The $1.00 Parliament is considered by many to be the key GeoV era high value. 2018 Scott US$600.00=	$750.00	$180.00
3740
70	Canada #159 (x 16). Sixteen used examples of the 1929 issue $1.00 olive green Parliament high value from the GeoV Scroll set. The $1.00 Parliament is considered by many to be the key GeoV high value. Any dated examples appear to be used in period. Expect the odd fault in a group like this. 2018 Scott US$1,280.00=	$1,600.00	$95.00
4824
71	Canada #162-174. VF mint NH examples of the 1c to 12c values from the 1930-1931 KGV "Arch" issue. Unitrade is $360.00 for the VF mint NH group. A nice start to a NH "Arch" set. 2018 Scott US$237.00=	$296.25	$160.00
4247

5038
74	Canada #183i. One VF mint NH and one VF used line pair of 1931 issue 3c deep red KGV Arch coil. The used line pair is strangely (in my humble opinion) severely undervalued in the catalogue. 2018 Unitrade.	$170.00	$70.00
4950
75	Canada #195-201, 205-207, 211-216, 217-227, 228-230. Mint hinged selection of KGV complete sets, including coils in pairs. 1932-1935 period issues. 2018 Scott US$520.30=	$650.38	$60.00
3912
76	Canada #211/314, C5-C9. All mint OG Hinged, generally VF quality comprehensive collection of 1935 to 1951 period GeoV and GeoVI issues. 79 different stamps in total, almost all in fresh complete sets. See the scan of the inventory list for more details. 2018 Scott US$599.65=	$749.56	$110.00
5397
77	Canada #211-216 (x 5 sets). Complete 1935 GeoV Silver Jubilee set of six, all VF mint NH x five complete sets. Note that three different generations of Royals are depicted on this set, consisting of four different Monarchs, including Princess Elizabeth, the future QEII.

1683
78	Canada #231/343, C7-C9. Generally F/VF mint H/NH (#262 is used) 1937 to 1954 GeoVI and early QEII period collection, all laid out on Lighthouse brand hingeless album pages. High quality material and numerous complete sets noted throughout. All the mint has been valued as Hinged even though NH material was noted. 2018 Scott $449.60=	$562.00	$80.00
4197
79	Canada #454/550. VF mint NH nearly complete run of matched sets of plate blocks of 1967 to 1973 issue QEII Centennial definitive series. Missing only one 3c block and the 25c has two upper right positions. While the papers, perfs, plates and gums may vary in some of the matched sets, all of the blocks have been valued as the cheapest paper/gum/perf/tagging types. Completely unchecked for better types and (sure to be some here). Owner's Unitrade.	$476.00	$140.00
5596
80	Canada #519-523, 524-528, 522i, 525i. Complete se-tenant sheets of 100 of the 1970 issue 5c and 6c Christmas stamps featuring the much sought after identical centre blocks of four and all sorts of Darnell listed identical pairs (not counted here). Each sheet is valued by Unitrade as one centre block, four plate blocks of ten, eight strips of five and sixteen singles. The 6c in the centre block does not have the "scratch through window" (scarcer and thus worth a 50% premium) and the 5c in the centre block has the "dot between M and A". Each VF MNH sheet is brilliantly pristine and unfolded (most sheets we see have usually been folded, usually through the block). 2017 Unitrade.	$584.00	$130.00
5445
81	Canada #582p-585p. Ten complete VF mint NH miniature panes of sixteen of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant "Earth Sciences" commemoratives, all the much scarcer general tagged types. All pristine and Post Office fresh. 2018 Unitrade.	$400.00	$60.00
5585
82	Canada #586/605, 729 Study. Specialized collection of stamps from the popular 1973 to 1976 (plus one 1977 issue) "Caricature and Landscape" series. The face values run from 1c to $1.00. The vast majority of the material consists of either mint NH matched sets of inscription blocks or Canada Post cacheted FDCs (also mostly plate blocks). There are 140 plate blocks, 20 FDCs, 320 precancels (in part sheets with warning strips) in total. In addition there is a mounted and annotated 15 page section of varieties from this series including listed and unlisted booklet, coil, precancel, printing and tagging oddities. A great lot for the student or soon to be student of this rewarding collecting area. The Unitrade determined total catalogue value is made up from regularly listed material ($816.60) and from values determined using the EFO guide in the front of Unitrade ($410.70). Total estimated Unitrade.	$1,227.30	$600.00
5614
83	Canada #732/884. Mint, used and First Day Cover collection of 1977 to 1981 period issues, all laid out on various types of hingeless Lighthouse brand album pages and stockpages, all packed into a bulging Lighthouse binder. Saw face values to $1.25. While the layout is a bit haphazard, this lot offers a wealth of variety from the period covered, as the collector wanted to represent each issue in as many ways as possible. The mint portion of the lot consists of 1,222 stamps (mostly in plate blocks, mainly matched sets), 1 souvenir sheet and 7 miniature panes. The used material consists of 1,094 stamps and 14 souvenir sheets and one miniature pane. There is also a parallel selection of FDCs plus other sundry bits and pieces. The lot has been valued for the mint face value contained in the collection only, but is worth considerably more due to the other useful material also in the collection which will have a substantial catalogue value. Total face value	$275.79	$280.00
4197
84	Canada #847/1766. All mint, all VFNH collection of 875 stamps, 34 souvenir sheets/miniature panes, 4 booklet panes, 1 complete booklet and 2 "stick 'n tick" labels, all 1980 to 1998 period issues. All laid out on hingeless Lighthouse brand album pages, in a red springback binder with matching slipcase (the empty album, pages and slipcase retail for over $200.00 new). Conservatively valued for the face value of the mint stamps contained in the album but worth more. Total face value	$486.82	$375.00
5389
85	Canada #878i. VARIETY. VF mint NH example of the 1981 issue 17c "Mandora", triple error, erroneously printed on gum side, missing the inscription and also untagged. Only 200 examples of this showpiece have been recorded, most with some kind of fault. This pristine and fault-free example is one of the nicer stamps from the original find (ex. Gary Lyon Philatelist), coming from sheet #1, position 37. 2017 Unitrade.	$2,000.00	$600.00
5445
86	Canada #907/1008. Mint, used and First Day Cover collection of 1981 to 1984 period issues, all laid out on various types of hingeless Lighthouse brand album pages and stockpages, all packed into a bulging Lighthouse binder. Saw face values to $2.00 (including plate blocks and a full sheet of the $2.00 Commonwealth Day commemorative). While the layout is a bit haphazard, this lot offers a wealth of variety from the period covered, as the collector wanted to represent each issue in as many ways as possible. The mint portion of the lot consists of 1,301 stamps, 5 booklets, 1 booklet pane, 9 souvenir sheets and 14 miniature panes. The used material consists of 779 stamps and 5 booklet panes. There is also a parallel selection FDCs, plus other sundry bits and pieces. The lot has been valued for the mint face value contained in the collection only, but is worth considerably more due to the other useful material also in the collection. Total face value	$619.21	$325.00
5614
87	Canada #926A. VF selection of 16 VF mint NH corner blocks (4 matched sets) of the short lived 1987 issue 36c plum QEII definitive (these don't come with inscriptions). The October 1st issue definitive was delayed repeatedly (from May 6, 1987) due to production difficulties and not released until near the end of the 36c rate period. Thus, this value was current for just three months, during which time the 1987 Christmas stamps would have seen most of the usage. A clean and increasingly scarce investment group. 2018 Unitrade.	$320.00	$55.00
1683
88	Canada #929i. VF mint NH matched set of plate blocks of the Unitrade listed "brown background" variety of the 1983 issue 48c "Cradle" medium-value definitive. Previously thought to be a magenta missing colour error, the colour variety is actually due to an anomaly in the ink used by the printer. A very distinctive error of colour. The lot also includes a VF mint NH single the true colour for conclusive comparison. 2017 Unitrade.	$1,001.00	$400.00
870
89	Canada #1534ii. 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2017 Unitrade.	$800.00	$325.00
3683
90	Canada #1630ai. VF MNH investment lot of 50 of the 1997 Year of the Ox souvenir sheet of two x 45c Lunar New Year stamps with the additional limited edition "Hong Kong 97" logo printed in lower right corner of the sheet. This is the scarcest (and first) Lunar New Year souvenir sheet. Excellent investment opportunity. 2017 Unitrade.	$500.00	$65.00
5233
91	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. Priced as four singles. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$190.00
5596
92	Canada #1818-1834. Complete VF MNH set of the 17 different Millennium sheets of four, each sheet in its own numbered glassine envelope. These are the sheets issued at the Post Office for a limited time in order for the stamps in the Millennium coffee table book to be recognized by catalogue publishers. Complete sets are getting tough to find. (Face value is $31.28). 2018 Unitrade.	$153.00	$65.00
5614
93	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH. The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2017 Unitrade.	$161.00	$70.00
4272
94	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$85.00
5342
95	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Normal sheet included for comparison. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. 2017 Unitrade.	$194.00	$150.00
3266
96	Canada #BK11 (English text). VF quality 1928 issue booklet containing four panes of six of the 1c orange KGV Scroll (#149a). Rare this nice. Valued with the Unitrade noted 50% premium for VF. 2018 Unitrade.	$300.00	$70.00
5444
97	Canada #BK31e (French text). Superb quality example of the 1937 issue KGVI booklet containing panes of four of the 1c, 2c and 3c "Mufti" definitives (#231a, 232a, 233a). Blue Type II cover, 6c airmail rate page. Scarce French text version, exceptional condition! 2018 Unitrade.	$210.00	$110.00
4841
98	Canada #BK34a, BK34b, BK34c, BK34d. FRENCH. Complete set of all four KGVI 3c carmine War Issue booklets (#251a) with French text. VF MNH. 2018 Unitrade.	$193.50	$24.00
4350
99	Canada #BK81/BK181a. Fifty definitive booklets (46 different),1970-1991, including BK81 (4 different),83, 85a, 89a, 98a, 103c, 110, 114, 127, 167b and 181a. A total $143.00 face value. Generally Fine MNH condition. 2016 Unitrade.	$457.00	$110.00
5444
100	Canada #BK106/BK461. Thirty-five different commemorative booklets - 1989-2011, including BK106,144-147,192,195, 219-220, 228-229, 279, 360 and 461. A total face value of $159.00. Generally Fine MNH condition. 2016 Unitrade.	$433.00	$120.00
4736
101	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$100.00
3773
102	Canada - Recalled Hanukkah Booklet Duo. Two VF mint NH intact examples of the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. Estimate	$100.00	$100.00
3398
103	Canada #C5ii. Fresh and VF mint Hinged (disturbed OG), perfectly centered example of the "Moulting Wing" variety on the 1935 issue 6c red brown Daedalus airmail stamp (plate #1, LR pane, position 14). A scarce and popular constant plate flaw. 2018 Unitrade.	$150.00	$65.00
4993
104	Canada #CP19-CP38, CP21ii, CP26ii, CP31ii, CP36ii. Post Office Fresh MNH set of Computer Vended Postage 'kiosk' stamp panes of 5 different designs, of all four denominations (Permanent, $1.20, $1.80 and $2.50), all dated November 24 2016, all with the short-lived 18-digit code and with the scarce Unitrade listed partial "11" at bottom left on the Tom Thomson design stamp. Strips dated this early can only have come from Vancouver and have the post office code 105341 at the beginning of the digit string. The partial "11" feature was apparently printed on the first strip in an order, and since most orders were rather large these strips are particularly scarce. These particular panes represent the key Unitrade-listed varieties from this issue. In my opinion, these panes are undervalued in Unitrade and should jump in value in the next edition. 2018 Unitrade.	$225.00	$150.00

This last issue is distinguishable from earlier printings due to the imprints being at the sides of the blocks. 2018 Unitrade.	$135.00	$65.00
