The booklets are very elusive and we've only just begun offering any for sale. While recognized and reviewed in numerous philatelic journals, Unitrade has yet to create an individual listing for this stamp, so we have used the Unitrade catalogue number for the frame design as our stamp reference. Two booklets are perfect for display purposes (front and back). Estimate =	$200.00	$120.00
5936
121	Canada #2793i. VF MNH $2.50 Red Kelly AUTOGRAPHED "hockey card" format S/S from the 2014 NHL "Original Six" issue, with the silver foil holographic Canada Post sticker of authenticity. With only 500 produced and considering that Red Kelly passed away in 2019 these cards have proven very popular with stamp and hockey card collectors alike. The italicized Unitrade value remains a woeful attempt at pricing for these signed limited-edition cards. 2023 Unitrade is $225.00, but these cards regularily sell for above that.

Material includes regular and back of the book postal issues, revenues, overprints, Gibbons listed items etc. Noted mint blocks and decent cancels in the mix.

6243
256	Ethiopia #321/976, B21/B26, C56/C85, J57. Clean and diverse mint and used collection of 324 stamps, 1951-1980 period issues.

258	France #1O29/1O62, 2O29/2O58. VF mint NH selection of "Conseil de L'Europe" and "UNESCO" issues, almost exclusively complete sets and usually four examples of each. Often overlooked "Back of the Book" issues, these stamps produced for use by these two internationally important organizations are much more for legitimate official use than their United Nations counterparts. 2023 Scott US$331.60=	$414.50	$36.00
5658
259	France #2101/3168. Comprehensive but not quite complete selection of Scott listed pre-cancels, 1993 to 2005 period, all in complete sets of VF mint NH blocks of four (a couple of blocks split into pairs).

5742
272	Germany #1, 3, 3a, 5, 14-17, 19-21, 24, 27. Used lot of thirteen "Eagle with small or large shield" issues of 1872-1874. A very useful group with above-average centering and freshness. A couple minor faults such as short perfs noted. 2021 Scott US$712.30 =	$890.35	$85.00
5719
273	Germany #1/136. A comprehensive collection of 187 stamps laid out on four stock pages, mint H and (mainly) used, from the 1872 to 1920 period. Includes most of the catalogued colour varieties and all in much better than average condition but the odd fault will still be found. Very nearly complete except for a few high values. The two imperforate stamps from the first issues are not valued as they are likely cut squares but they are in perfect condition and clearly demonstrate the two embossed centres, i.e. the Small and Large Shields. Owner's 2019 Scott US$1,769.75=	$2,212.19	$100.00
5977

5977
275	Germany #670-685. Stunning MNH "Numeral and Post Horn" 1951-52 set of 16, fresh with vivid colours and rare thus. As nice a set as you will see for some time. 2021 Scott US$1700.00 =	$2,125.00	$260.00
2591
276	Germany #B68. VF centered unused souvenir sheet of 4, "OSTROPA 1935" watermarked issue. Some light staining away from stamps. As the gum on this issue contains sulphuric acid and tends to damage the sheet, most have had the gum removed; the Scott catalogue value is for an ungummed sheet. 2021 Scott US$975.00 =	$1,218.75	$90.00
5479
277	Germany #B104, B106. VF MNH 1937 issue pair of souvenir sheets with marginal inscriptions on the se-tenant labels, perforated 14 around stamps and rouletted into the margins.

6087
278	Germany #C27-C37. Very fresh mint 1926-27 and 1928-31 Airmail sets. The "German Eagle" set of 8 shows 7 stamps with only the barest trace of hinging at the extreme upper right corner - at first AND second glances they appear NH - and the "Graf Zeppelin Crossing Ocean" set off 3 has hinged full OG. Consider that the price of a NH set of #C27-C34 increases nearly 8 times to $900 and this is an uncommon opportunity to acquire a virtually NH set without the corresponding premium. 2021 Scott US$205.85 =	$257.30	$70.00
2712
279	Germany - Collections in Albums and on Pages. Neatly organized group of collections, all housed in high quality Lindner or Lighthouse albums or on loose album pages.

280	Germany - German States Collection. Offered intact as received original old-time collection of pre-Unification German States, all Hinged on trimmed quadrille pages. Noted mint and used stamps as well as some reprints and forgeries in the mix. The overall quality seems pretty decent and the range of material is respectable but expect some faulty stamps in an unpicked lot of this type. Assembled in Europe (Italy) a long time ago. High total catalogue value but take a very good look at the high quality scans to determine the quality, authenticity and value for yourself. Estimate =	$500.00	$280.00
5621
281	Germany - MNH collection of full and part sheets in two sheet files, mainly from the turn of the 20th century to the inflationary period of the mid-1920's. Just shy of 3000 stamps in total including Back of the Book issues.Estimate=	$150.00	$48.00

A couple of the Penny Blacks have been identified for plates. Expect a fault or two but still a great group of "number ones". Valued for the stamps only. 2023 Scott US$ 2,625.00=	$3,281.25	$425.00
6035
285	Great Britain #1 to Recent Plus Extras. Meaty and valuable balance of thousands of stamps from an extensive almost all used GB collection/accumulation in stock books, on album pages, envelopes and loose. Expect some faults in the mix but this lot represents a very rewarding goldmine sorting project for the student of GB philately. Saw a decent range of early imperfs, covers, Victorian, Edwardian and GeoV values to 10sh, lots of "Penny Reds" to plate, Offices and Officials and lots more, with enough total catalogue to have you humming "Rule Britannia" for weeks. Well worth the investment at the conservative estimate. Estimate =	$1,500.00	$2,750.00
4431

Several perf and paper varieties that are only listed in Chan are noted (these varieties are valued as standard Scott). RoC provincial issues are represented (eg. Ki-Hei, Sinkiang), as well as Communist provincial issues, Japanese occupation, air mail and postage dues. RoC era stamps are mostly used; PRC era stamps are both used and unused, with reprints noted and valued accordingly. An excellent backbone for further completion, with many low-value stamps still outstanding and/or for further specialization. Also included are 4 Vario sheets containing different kinds of used RoC multiples (pairs, strips of 3, 4 etc), blocks (of 4, 6+ etc), and margin/corner copies (including a numbered corner plate block and an East China margin multiple of 12). The multiples have Scott and Chan numbers, with paper, perf and width variations noted; basic values (ie 4 x single cat for a block) are identified for a few, but most are unvalued. Finally, this lot includes a Vario sheet with approx 100 RoC singles and a 1998 Stanley Gibbons China catalogue. Expect the usual small faults in a lot of this kind, particularly on RoC material (rough perfs, glue remainder, etc). Owner's Scott 2021 cat as follows: RoC US$390.00; PRC US$866.00; valued multiples US$160.00; unvalued multiples and extra singles cat estimate of US$50.00.

322	Japan - Deluxe stockbook with definitive issues and Offices Abroad (in China and Korea), almost exactly 2000 stamps organized chronologically.

2299
323	Japan - Stockbook with almost exclusively commemorative issues from 1900 to 1999 including some Parks issues, 820 stamps including S/S organized more or less chronologically.

The top row (#1, 4, 4, 6, 7, 14) are faulty and have not been counted; the other 2 faulty stamps are turned upside down and not counted either. 56 stamps with some bonus early issues to continue this part of your Benelux collection. 2021 Scott US$427.05 =	$533.80	$140.00
5964

Foremost is the nicely used souvenir sheet #B131, a tribute to Luxembourg's war heroes and martyrs.

5964

A very uncommon opportunity to fill this spot in your album! 2022 Scott US$1500.00 =	$1,875.00	$400.00
6087
332	Luxembourg #B1/B104. Fresh used lot of 1921 to 1940 semi-postal issues, all in complete sets though with a few faults noted (these have been turned upside down and not counted).

5964

1751
336	Malaysia and Malayan States Selection - Moderately duplicated selection of over 100 mint and used stamps, 1894 to 1986 period issues. All neatly laid out on four Hagner brand stock sheets.

4389
337	Malaysia, Malaya and States Stock - Three stock books of nicely organized mostly used stock of very early through relatively modern Malayan and Malaysian stamps. All of the States are represented. While a nice range of useful and better items were noted, there are not many completes sets in the lot. The higher used values are a mix of postal and fiscal cancels (as usual). Unchecked for cancels or varieties. Estimate =	$400.00	$210.00
4844
338	Manchukuo #1/164, C4. Fabulous starter collection of this Japanese puppet state in Manchuria (Northeastern China), 1932-45 issues in sets and singles.

A better than good start to the early issues of this French Caribbean island paradise. 2022 Scott US$991.65=	$1,239.56	$240.00
4776
340	Netherlands Selection - Almost all used, all different selection of 144 regular stamps and 56 semi-postals, beginning with the first issues and running up into the 1930s. All accurately valued by the consignor and neatly laid out on two double-sided Vario brand stock sheets. CTOs and facsimiles have been noted and valued (or not counted) appropriately. Here's a great start to the more classic material of this popular and interesting low-lying European nation. Owner's Scott Catalogue $1,775.65=	$2,219.56	$325.00
5984
341	New Zealand #28B/2104, AR102/P4.

6087

Better than average condition for these, sound examples except note #35 short corner, 36a corner crease, 37 short corner, 39 stain, and 41 short corner. Expect some short perfs as is normal for these. The three high value imperfs are close cut in some cases, but are normal for these given the very narrow margins between stamps. 2022 Scott US$ 1320.00 =	$1,650.00	$250.00
6246
343	New Zealand - Choice offering of 1938 - 1971 mint hinged on Scott Specialty Album pages, complete for the period except missing one 25¬¢ value item. Has all the scarce ones, including #244, 298B, 300, 301, 320, 349, 352, 404, etc. No back of the book, just the regular issues. Generally F-VF sound examples.

A few extraneous stamps incuded e.g. Western Ukraine and other unissued material. Owner's 2019 Scott US$503.30=	$629.13	$80.00

6087
28	Canada #3Pii. Badly damaged and roughly "restored" plate proof of the famous 12 Penny Black, with diagonal "SPECIMEN" overprint in carmine. Still the Holy Grail of any Canadian collection, rarely seen in ANY condition. 2022 Unitrade =	$6,000.00	$925.00

Estimate=	$200.00	$200.00
5410
37	Canada #13. Forgery. Looks like a used #13 but is most likely a faded and illicitly perforated #5 (the 6p Consort on wove paper). A genuine #13 catalogues for US$7,500.00 in Scott. A nice reference item for Ken Pugh or a convincing looking spacefiller for your collection until you acquire the genuine article. Estimate =	$325.00	$130.00

133	Canada #2791i. VF condition and VERY RARE autographed $2.50 "Harry Howell" hockey card format high value from the 2014 issue "Original Six" NHL defensemen series (Harry passed away in 2019). The Unitrade catalogue value for these extremely popular signed stamps has proven to be meaningless, with most cards selling well over the posted catalogue value. 2022 Unitrade $185.00. Estimate =	$300.00	$375.00
3929
134	Canada #2877i. VF MNH Bernie Parent AUTOGRAPHED "hockey card" format S/S from the 2015 NHL "Great Canadian Goalies"¬ù issue. Has the silver foil holographic Canada Post sticker of authenticity.

1786
135	Canada #BK623, BK686, BK686A. Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet, recalled almost within hours on the official issue date due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane in the marginal "traffic lights." The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. Included is the new revised booklet with a different cover and pane design. Estimate =	$150.00	$75.00

The Unitrade listed #E9i (broken "0") catalogues for $131.25 in VF NH condition. While neither of these two broken numeral positions are not specifically the Unitrade listed one, they are at least as scarce (and probably scarcer). A regular inscription block of ten without varieties catalogues for $232.75. A VFNH inscription block containing TWO varieties has to be worth multiples of this price. Estimate=	$500.00	$190.00

Note that this cover truly saw the whole country, sent via Halifax NS and Vancouver BC before being sent on a steamship for Australia (likely CPR). The second cover, posted exactly 3 years earlier (Sept 4th 1933) from Craig Harbour NWT via the SS Nascopie to Reading, Pennsylvania (via St.Johns NFLD).

As Port Burwell was a "Non-Post Office Point" the mail received from the ship was cancelled aboard the RMS Nascopie. Registered mail is far scarcer than regular mail, with this cover picking up a great strike of the RMS Nascopie Registration Box to complement the 7 strikes of the Nascopie oval postmark (front and back). This cover will also appeal to the 1939 Royal Visit collector, as it would be a showpiece item in a Royal Visit exhibit.

6012
174	Canada Covers - Eastern Arctic Mail. Mail carried by the SS Beothic, sent from Ponds Inlet Baffin Island on September 12th 1931 to Oakland, California via North Sydney NS. The delivery and pick up of mail in the Eastern Arctic was a difficult venture before advent of airmail to the region. Mail was carried and picked up by government official expeditions (the Eastern Arctic Patrols) which made only one trip per year. In 1931, the SS Beothic was the ship used by the Eastern Arctic Patrol. A scarce item, neatly displayed on exhibit / Northern Canada Study Group advertising page.

77
325	Korea (North) - Collection in Fat Stock Book. Mint and used collection of hundreds of stamps and souvenir sheets, ranging from the first issues of the late 1940s up to the 2010s. A great lot that shows the self-declared progress of the "Hermit Kingdom" as well as the succession of leadership (Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un). Not easy stamps to find due to the US embargo on North Korean material. Significant catalogue value here, especially if you use a catalogue like Michel for the valuation. Estimate=	$250.00	$260.00

326	Labuan #5/97. Mint and used collection of 1880-1900 issues, 24 stamps hinged to 2-post Scott Specialty album pages. This appears to be a complete set pages for issues up to 1905 before the stamps of Labuan were replaced by those of the Straits Settlements. 2021 Scott US$502.40 =	$628.00	$42.00

332	Macao #161b. Mint no gum (as issued) intact (unsevered) 5a surcharge in red on 10a King Carlos "pair". The provisionally surcharged 10a stamp was supposed to be bisected and used as two 5a stamps due to the lack of 5a values at the post office. A very few of these stamps remained unsevered. This is the rarest and highest cataloguing stamp of Macao, missing from most collections. One short perf at top noted for the record. 2023 Scott US$700.00=	$875.00	$140.00
4776

The regular issues are all complete sets. The #110-125 have the usual brownish gum. Note that the Scott catalogue value is for Hinged. As this is an almost all NH group, these stamps should command a decent premium! 2022 Scott US$323.20=	$404.00	$65.00
5817
340	New Zealand #33/842a, B8/B122, E2, J2/J28, O23/O109, OY2/OY56. Used collection of 860 stamps hinged to pages in a Stanley Gibbons album with slipcase.

The group has been carefully identified by Scott numbers followed by Gibbons numbers. Shades are identified as per Gibbons, with catalogue values based on Scott. This interesting and classic set, far better described in a specialized manner by Gibbons than by Scott. Admirals are a great challenge for British Africa collectors. Owner notes two 1/ greens (Scott 130a) and two 1d aniline reds (Scott 120p: a 1924 printing for use only in Northern Rhodesia after BSAC stamps had been demonetized in the South). While colour determinations can be subjective, discovering shade gradations is part of the fun of collecting Rhodesian Admirals!

93	Ukraine - "Russian warship, go f*** yourself!" Souvenir Sheet" One of the most popular rallying cries of the Ukrainian resistance emerged early in the war, when soldiers stationed on a Black Sea military outpost called Snake Island responded to Russian troops' calls to surrender with a few choice words: "Russian warship, go f*** yourself!" The incident has been memorialized in a special postage stamp, which proud Ukrainians lined up en masse to buy. The stamp honors the Ukrainian soldiers who profanely told off a Russian warship. The Ukrainian Postal Service (Ukrposhta) held a postage stamp competition to commemorate the soldiers, who were initially believed to have been killed but were actually held captive and released in a prisoner swap in late March. The winning design, as chosen by social media voters, was announced in March and issued in April. It shows a lone Ukrainian soldier standing on shore, raising a middle finger at a looming gray warship in the water. Artist Boris Groh said he was so impressed by the soldiers' refusal to surrender that he decided to submit an illustration to lift morale. He told the postal service that it took him three days to complete the sketch, but he could have done it in five hours if he hadn't been distracted by the news. This sheet is presently selling on eBay for up to $300.00 a sheet. The "W"¬ù rate is the original rate for this stamp a later 'F"¬ù rate also exists, as do large numbers of non-genuine reproduction "labels"¬ù.T his sheet is the real deal, a limited issue slice of modern history! We will be donating the proceeds of the sale of this lot to the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in Victoria which has several programs set up to aid the Ukraine and refugee Ukrainian citizens.	$150.00	$230.00

4279
215	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #128. VF used 3c on 15c scarlet surcharge with the bars 10√Ç¬Ω mm apart. Unobtrusive light partial cancel at upper left corner. 2022 Unitrade =	$350.00	$120.00

Mint and used mini collection nearly covering the spectrum of Newfoundland Inland, Money Order, Customs and War Savings revenues, the obviously faulty #NFW1 not counted. The overprint on 5c ultra 1910 issue is known with varieties, and here is an example with the period after "only"¬ù missing.2022 van Dam =	$1,077.00	$80.00
6012
220	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland - #C3h on Cover. VF example of the 1921 Halifax Airmail overprint, showing the 1.5 mm spacing between AIR and MAIL variety as the period after 1921 variety. Tied by a St. John's NFLD machine cancel to a neat General Post Office cover addressed to Philadelphia. Only 2,224 of this setting were printed, with only a small portion of these still on cover. Of particular note is the recipient of this cover, philatelist Joseph A. Steinmetz. As well as being the president of the Aero Club, he owned two different "Inverted Jennys"¬ù. He was also the high profile collector embroiled in a 1911 court case where he was indicted for bribing a post office employee in return for sheets of rare US stamps that had been slated for official destruction.

Lots of upside if revalued by European catalogues. Includes better like #832-835, 1241-1246, 1435-1439 plus a handful of proofs not counted in the total. A great lot for the collector wanting extra traders or the dealer looking for unusual material. 2023 Scott US$2,082.15=	$2,602.69	$140.00

All 4 issued colours of the overprint are represented, in violet, red, black and green as well as a single with overprint in blue with stated 4 copies known. The handstamp nature of the overprints lends itself to many errors and varieties and here we have doubled, inverted, sideways, additional and missing overprints in spades. There are also at least 3 types of the overprint recorded and these have been meticulously noted on the album pages, including with the Sanabria Airmail Catalogue numbers. Also includes a flown cover to Southwest Africa. Catalogued merely as basic stamps the Scott value is US$275.75 but intact specialized collections with multiples research possibilities are very hard to come by anymore.	$500.00	$650.00

245	France - French Offices in Egypt "Port Said" 1/80, B1. Mint and (mostly) used collection of 1899-1925 issues, 71 stamps on trimmed album pages. Very uncommon material which includes type varieties the 5c greenn 1899 issue have been identified by the previous collector (who was meticulous and invariably correct) as both Types I and II, but have been valued conservatively as Type I since the low centering makes it nearly impossible to read the INV below REPUBLIQUE"¬ù in the lower left corner. 2021 Scott US$1289.30 =	$1,611.60	$130.00
3223
246	French Equatorial Africa #C9-C16. Mint and used collection of the 1940-41 "Afrique Franaise Libre" overprinted Airmail issues, including a part set in unusual mint blocks of 4 and with the 2 key 1.50fr and 3.75fr values used with clean CDS cancels. Less than 4,000 of each of the latter were printed and they are equally scarce mint or used. Numerous overprinting flaws and varieties have been pointed out by the previous owner. 2021 Scott US$1035 =	$1,293.75	$260.00
4776
247	French Guinea #1-62, 63/103, J1-J15. Exceptional collection of complete sets for issues from 1892 to 1913 including Postage Dues, mixed mint and used stamps hinged to 3 trimmed album pages.

Many of the sheets are listed in Michel and priced with a premium for the marginal inscriptions, and some constant plate varieties have also been noted by the previous owner. 2022 Scott US$2255 =	$2,818.75	$210.00
5595
250	Germany - Absolute top quality and very comprehensive mint NH collection of 1954 to 2006 period issues, including commemoratives, definitives, booklets, souvenir sheets, semi-postals, airmails and computer generated types. All the stamps are on high end hingeless "BORE"¬ù brand album pages (these pages are worth $500.00 alone as new!). The stamps themselves got beyond basic Scott listed types and varieties, with illustrated marginal tabs, coil strips, se-tenants and a good number of items that may only be found in a specialized catalogue like Michel. Huge total catalogue value. Significant face value in useable 21st century euro valued stamps a well as an absolute fortune in the devalued Deutschmark material.

6246
260	Great Britain #1. Penny Pincher's packet of Penny Blacks. Used group of 11 Penny Blacks, the world's first postage stamp.

These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. 2022 Unitrade =	$200.00	$150.00
5595

Has a few semi-postals. Includes some of the latest Covid period issues through 2021. Few people use postal mail these days, especially commemoratives, so this material is quite hard to obtain.

4485
225	Canada - Modern / Latest Used - 112 different 2020-2021 issues only. These are so hard to find since so few people used Canada's postal system during the Covid period. Includes the very scarce 'Flying Postal Truck' issued only to postal employees! Estimate =	$120.00	$110.00

226	Canada - Modern Used Treasure Trove. Superlative quality offering of well over 4900 modern used (1988-2011 period issues) on close-cut paper and off paper. Carefully selected fault-free stamps, assembled into four different sub-groups: #1) 2010-2011 on close-cut single paper (1,900+ pieces); #2) 2005-2009 on close-cut single paper (1,500+ pieces); #3) 1995-1998 on close-cut single paper (500+ pieces); and #4) 1988 off paper (1,000+ pieces). The consignor assembled these offerings with great care and a critical eye, "undercounting" each group just in case he missed something. If you like this lot, more of the same will be coming in future sales. Estimate =	$325.00	$230.00

227	Canada - Mostly Mint 1927 to 1978 Period Collection in Minkus Album. Well represented collection of 799 stamps, including regular issues (716 stamps at US$2,275.35), Airmails (14 stamps at US$146.10), Semi-postals (12 stamps at US$6.90), Special Deliveries (9 stamps at US$105.00), Postage Dues (33 stamps at US$17.70) and Officials (15 stamps US$112.00). The quality of the mint material is quite high with quite a bit of NH noted but as we couldn't inspect every stamp, all the mint have been conservatively valued as Hinged. This particular collection will form a very decent basis for expansion with lots of upside. 2022 Scott US$2,562.05=	$3,202.56	$190.00

228	Canada - Post Office Presentation Book for the 1932 Ottawa Conference. Extremely rare (Holmes reports only 200 examples produced) official Canadian Post Office produced stamp booklet/portfolio offered to delegates attending the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference. Also known as the Ottawa Conference, it was a 1932 conference of British colonies and dominions held to discuss the Great Depression. It was held between 21 July and 20 August in Ottawa. The book itself, as described by Holmes: "Green morocco cover has Canadian Coat of Arms in the center with 1932-OTTAWA-CONFERENCE printed in three lines above the coat of arms and CANADA below. Whole design in gold. Ottawa Conference and 1930 issues, singles. The mint stamps contained in the book consist of Scott #163/177 (including the 50c Grand Pre and $1.00 Cavell), 190, 191, 192-194, C3-C4, E4. All the stamps are fresh and NH, except for the #193 which is mysteriously affixed to the page (did someone sneeze while assembling the book?). Needless to say, the vast majority of these presentation portfolios have been scattered to the four corners of the Empire and probably very few remain intact, let alone as nice as this one. Estimate =	$1,500.00	$450.00

These variations are not always visible to the naked eye but are easily spotted using the SAFE-Signoscope. Quick and easy to use - simply place your stamp under the optical block in the pull out slide, tighten the slide in its recess and turn on the light. Repairs, thin areas and watermark variations will be quickly identified. For ease of use in high volume situations, or examining stamps with difficult watermarks choose the T1 Professional model with higher power and adjustable light source, or for great portability why not try the compact T2 model. It's simple and works quickly. Just place your stamp into the Signocope. If there is a watermark, it will show, even on yellow or orange stamps. You don't need to have any special skills or training to see the watermarks.". European retail new 165 euros=$225.00 CAD. Estimate	$150.00	$200.00

In December 1985, the Campbell Island P.O. lost the "Campbell Island" registration hammer in a post office fire.

While the P.O. request was approved in 1977 (and the hammers made), the post office never did come into existence due to the considerable cost of transferring the mail. There is one additional "twin" cover existing in addition to the one offered in this sale.

299	Worldwide Supplies - Detectamark Spectrum Watermark Detector Lightly used, almost AS NEW in the original box: The Stanley Gibbons Detectamark Spectrum makes it even easier to discover the hidden rarities in your collection. This battery powered device operates via pressure applied evenly to the stamp by means of a recessed screw in the base of the device. It is simple to use and the multiple colour settings and adjustable light source, unique to the Detectamark Spectrum, provide additional help when identifying more difficult watermarks. It even shows up watermarks on modern stamps printed on thick, chalk-surfaced papers with full gum - the ones that other detectors fail to identify. It is clean safe and very effective, without the use of chemicals and solvents and also helps to detect minor damage, such as thins, tears or repairs How to get the best from your Detectamark Spectrum: The effectiveness of the Detectamark Spectrum depends on the shadows being cast in the paper where the watermark design has been impressed into it, it is important to minimise the amount of external light which can get into the machine through the viewing aperture. Ideally it should be used in a darkened room, although total darkness is not necessary. Suitable for stamps up to 2" x 1 3/4" (50 x 45 mm) in size, battery powered (4 x 1.5 V AA batteries, not included), multiple light colors available: white, red, green, blue, reinforced plastic housing.

4201
132	Canada #454/465A. Massive used accumulation of low to high value Centennial definitives, offered as received and unchecked by us for varieties. Neatly arranged on 171 double-sided Vario stock pages (mostly 8-row, retail $2 each) in 3 like-new heavy duty D-ring binders. With some quick math this lot contains in the neighbourhood of 15,000 stamps and this could be a treasure trove for someone looking for paper types and tagging varieties. Huge potential catalogue value! Estimate =	$350.00	$210.00
3619
133	Canada #544x. VARIETY (BK70c part pane). VF mint NH example of the 8c slate "Library of Parliament" Centennial definitive, in the fourth row of the partial booklet pane of 18 from Unitrade #BK70c, short printed at right. Still mounted on the original album page. Unitrade describes the error as "part of design missing from right margin 8c stamp in 4th row". Se-tenant with regular stamps above and below. Only about 100 examples of this eye-catching error are known. Unitrade is $250.00 for the intact error booklet but it's the single stamp that's the key. This may be an earlier state of the "short printing". See lot #90 from bidboard 1920 for another example. Estimate =	$150.00	$90.00
6012
134	Canada #1172, 1172d. Two VF MNH plate/corner blocks of four of the 45c "Pronghorn", including the better perf 13.1 variety from the 1988-1990 Mammal medium-value definitive series. An elusive value from an increasingly popular series. 2022 Unitrade =	$156.25	$70.00

4249
136	Canada #2011b. VF mint imperforate pair of the 2003 issue 49c "Flag over Edmonton" booklet stamp (Fasson paper) with full inscription tab at bottom, proving conclusively that this is an ex-booklet pair. Normal pair with die cuts included for comparison. A scarce modern error. Valued as a regular imperf pair but the inscription should be worth a good premium. 2015 Unitrade =	$200.00	$100.00
870
137	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing a souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly (impossible to find) and dog (almost as hard to find) thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. These sets have been increasing and will increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2022 Unitrade =	$200.00	$120.00
5604
138	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c.

A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2022 Unitrade =	$650.00	$210.00
6035
139	Canada #2586. Canada Post THANKS/MERCI! Picture Postage, Card and Pin Complete Kit.

Truck and Rainbow design Picture Postage stamp, issued on November 30th 2020, ONLY TO CANADA POST EMPLOYEEES, plus a thank you card and matching rainbow pin. The booklets are very elusive and we've only just begun offering any for sale. While recognized and reviewed in numerous philatelic journals, Unitrade has yet to create an individual listing for this stamp, so we have used the Unitrade catalogue number for the frame design as our stamp reference. Two booklets are perfect for display purposes (front and back). Estimate =	$200.00	$375.00
4841
140	Canada #2845, 2847a (BK623). Hoodoos Booklet.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The covers have different cancels in red and black from the same Mississauga, Ontario Post Office, #104368 in Central Parkway Mall, which is a verified Canada Post outlet so the Unitrade warning about manipulated dates does not apply. No Canada Post outlet would engage in spurious backdating. Estimate =	$200.00	$100.00
5898
141	Canada #2847a (BK623). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. 2022 Unitrade =	$200.00	$190.00
6251
142	Canada #3052/3136, B27. VF MNH collection of 2018 issues on Parliament-brand album pages, numbered 681-705 with extra blank pages at the end. Aside from the slightly confused 'Far and Wide' definitive section (with a jumble of booklet, souvenir sheet and coil issues but boasting the Fall '18 coil set from rolls of 5000 with valley at top left) this is a complete set of issues for the year with souvenir sheets, panes of 5 and singles from both souvenir sheets and booklets. Although the die cuts catalogue higher in Unitrade, singles cut from booklets can be harder to find. The total face value of the usable postage is $211.02 including 151 'Permanent' stamps. 2022 Unitrade =	$456.00	$160.00
6039

The catalogue value is a combination of 2021 Scott Classic (for the perfins), 2022 Scott and 2022 van Dam catalogues. Scott US$4381.70 + van Dam C$440.15 =	$5,917.28	$250.00
5841
144	Canada #BK106a. VF complete booklet of the 33c "Greet More" Christmas 1989 issue pane of 10 on the scarcer High Fluorescence paper. Pristine unopened condition. Although easy to find as singles or pairs, an intact booklet is much harder to come by. 2022 Unitrade =	$250.00	$85.00
6128
145	Canada #BK106-BK109. Two complete sets of four VF condition intact mint NH 1989 issue Christmas booklets consisting of the 33c ($3.30), 38c ($3.80), 44c ($2.20) and 76c ($3.80) value booklets.

6217
146	Canada #C1/MR7.

222	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #4. F/VF appearing used example of the 1851 issue 6p yellow green imperf. Moderate and unobtrusive grid postmark. Small thins noted on the AIEP certificate. Still a very decent looking pre-Confederation classic. 2015 Scott US$825.00=	$1,031.25	$90.00
6001
223	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #8. Decently centered, fresh and F/VF mint OG (disturbed) part sheet of 49 of the 1860-1863 issue 1c black Victoria. Note two complete "American Bank-Note Co.

2050
224	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #1. F/VF centered used example of the 1861 issue 2p dull rose Victoria, perf 9 x 9. Nice appearance, with full perfs all around but has a tiny pinpoint thin (as often seen with this soft paper stock). Rare and attractive even with faults. 2022 Scott US$325.00=	$406.25	$160.00
6108
225	Chile - Chile and Peru Collections. While not complete, these two country collections are usefully comprehensive, both perfect candidates for expansion and eventual completion. The Chile section contains 675 stamps with a Scott value of US$492.15 and the Peru contains 858 stamps plus 2 souvenir sheets with a Scott value of US$925.55. 2022 Scott US$ 1,417.70=	$1,772.12	$160.00

4858
227	Cyprus - Mostly used collection of 172 stamps, 1880 to 1967 period issues, the majority still mounted on the original Scott Specialty album pages. While there are not that many complete sets, there are a useful number of higher value singles noted. Excellent basis for expansion. 2022 Scott US$1,068.40=	$1,335.50	$120.00
2951

5178
232	Gibraltar - Collection. Mostly used collection of 120 stamps, 1886 to 1969 period issues the majority still mounted on the original Scott Specialty album pages. While there are not that many complete sets, there are a useful number of earlier and higher value singles noted. Excellent basis for expansion. 2022 Scott US$1,101.60=	$1,377.00	$75.00
2951
233	Great Britain #1. on Cover. The famous 1840 issue "Penny Black" on 1840 folded letter to Reading. Deep shade with indistinct red "Maltese Cross" cancel. December 13th (?) 1840 Reading receiver on reverse. 2021 Scott for #1 on cover US$750.00=	$937.50	$150.00
4224
234	Great Britain #1, 2. Fine appearing used duo of the world's "First Issues" consisting of the 1840 issue Queen Victoria "Penny Black" and the scarcer "Two Pence Blue". Margins full to just in, red and black Maltese Cross cancels respectively. Unchecked for plates. The #1 is sound, while the #2 has a small marginal thin at upper right. Great start to a GB or Worldwide collection! 2022 Scott US$1,325.00=	$1,656.25	$210.00
5285
235	Great Britain #3. Complete Reconstructed Sheet. Used group of 240 examples of the 1841 issue "Penny Red" imperf, faithfully reconstructing an entire sheet by corner letter position. On the whole a very decent quality offering. The actual individual plates and shades have not been identified so there's lots of potential additional upside for the collector willing to further study and plate each stamp. Valued by Scott catalogue as basic stamps. 2022 Scott US$7,800.00=	$9,750.00	$400.00
6108
236	Great Britain #3. Numbered Maltese Cross Duo. Two used examples of the 1841 issue Penny red imperf, both with premium London numbered Maltese Cross cancels, numbers #10 and #12. A sound and Fine pair, each with legible and decently struck postmarks. 2021 Scott Classic US$675.00=	$843.75	$80.00
6005
237	Great Britain #3. Scarce Multiples A scarce used block of four and an ever scarcer used block of six of the 1841 issue Penny Red imperf. The two upper stamps in the block of four are thinned but the balance of the stamps in the two blocks are sound. Considering that only multiples up to blocks of four are valued in Scott Classic, the lot has been valued as two blocks of four and an additional two singles. 2021 Scott Classic US$765.00=	$956.25	$140.00
6087
238	Great Britain #4. Maltese Cross Trio. Three used examples of the 1841 issue 2 Penny Blue, all with premium Maltese Cross cancels.

1837
239	Great Britain #4, 4a. MULTIPLES. Three used strips (2 x strips of four and one strip of nine) of the 1841 issue 2 Penny blue imperf. Uneven margins on all the pieces but still very rare multiples. Scott Classic values strips of THREE at US$425.00 per strip, so strips of four (AND NINE!) should be worth a substantial additional premium. Estimate =	$1,000.00	$130.00
5038
240	Great Britain #5. VF appearing used example of the 1847 issue 1sh pale green embossed imperf with vertical silk threads. Margins well clear to huge on all sides. Some minor splitting along the vertical silk security thread does not detract from the much nicer than usual appearance of this difficult early high value imperf. 2022 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,250.00	$160.00
6108
241	Great Britain #33. (Plates 86, 179, 212).

4318
242	Great Britain #33. Plates on Cover Plus Extras. Nearly complete run of "Penny Red" plates (missing only plates #77 and 225) on cover, plus a couple of additional covers thrown in for good measure. Collected over decades, this group represents a near life-long quest to complete a set of plates of these popular GB Classics. Conservatively valued by Scott Classic catalogue, which is a general basic valuation for the most common cancels and usages. An excellentr candidate for further research and expansion. 2021 Scott Classic over US$3,400.00=	$4,250.00	$575.00
3773
243	Great Britain #58. PLATE #9. Sound and Fine used example of the RARE PLATE 9 of the 1870 issue ¬Ωp rose "Bantam" cancelled with a clear strike of the "132" barred numeral postmark (Brighton).

6108
244	Great Britain #111-122. Fresh and VF mint complete set of all twelve Queen Victoria "Jubilees", 1887-1892 period issues. Mostly LH (a couple of values with light pencil notes on gum), this is a superior quality offering of these late Victorian era issues. 2022 Scott US$653.20=	$816.50	$875.00
6246
245	Great Britain #142, 209. Used examples of the 1902 issue ¬£1 blue green Edward and the 1929 issue ¬£1 black GeoV UPU commemorative. Both stamps have small faults (the #142 has a damaged upper right corner and the #209 has a rounded lower left corner). More than acceptable "spacefillers" that you can swap out and upgrade at a later date. 2021 Scott Classic US$1,500.00=	$1,875.00	$260.00
5285

3634
249	Great Britain #U4. Unused 1840 issue 2p blue "Mulready" letter sheet, position a90. Faults (including creases and tears). Still a very presentable and rare example of the world's first pre-paid 2p letter sheet. 2021 Scott Classic US$440.00=	$560.00	$60.00
3634

In particular reference to #210 the consignor states "it's nice to get a $1,900.00 stamp for $10.50!". Also, the #48 is an excellent example of this scarce stamp.Owner's estimated 2019 Scott US$845.50=	$1,056.88	$190.00

Estimate =	$150.00	$100.00

A desirable lot for the coil specialist and error/EFO enthusiast alike. Estimate=	$150.00	$70.00
6035

4248
101	Canada #1520ai. VF mint NH upper left plate block of the 43c se-tenant 1994 XV Commonwealth Games commemorative with the VERY RARE "SILVER INK" variety of the "CANADA 43" on all stamps as well as in the "traffic lights" in upper left selvedge. Very likely a unique positional block as we have seen less than 20 examples of this eye-catching error reach the market in 25 years!

870

6035

Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time.

189	China - Manchuria. Bright, fresh and F/VF mint ALL NH selection of 25 examples of the 1929 issue 4c olive green "Unification" commemorative, overprinted for use in Manchuria. Scott does not have a price for Never Hinged as of yet. I would venture a guess that it would be multiples of the hinged base price of US$3.75 each. This group is easily worth full catalogue. 2022 Scott US$93.75=	$117.19	$42.00
4713

6060
196	Falkland Islands #100. Plus, Singapore #22. The two key 1948 GeoVI Silver Wedding high values, both VF mint LH. 2022 Scott US$225.00=	$281.25	$130.00
5178
197	Falkland Islands #128-142, 166-179. Two pretty and popular VF mint NH topical sets, consisting of the set of 15 of the bi-colour 1960 "Birds", (IMHO one of the prettiest Bird topical issues) and the 1968 issue "Falkland's Flora" set of 14. A top quality group. 2022 Scott US$255.30=	$319.30	$65.00

198	France #64/240. Almost all used collection of 88 different stamps, 1876 to 1927 period issues. The collection begins with the "Peace and Commerce" (Type Sage) issues, up through the "Liberty and Peace" material, then through the "Rights of Man", "Sowers" and "Pasteur" designs. Generally sound and Fine, but expect the odd fault. Owner's 2021 Scott US$1,741.80=	$2,177.25	$180.00
4170
199	France #B301a, B309a. VF mint NH intact 1955-56 issue Red Cross semi-postal booklets with pane of 10 and gutter pane of 8, respectively. The 15fr + 5fr 'Child with Goose' is the key Red Cross booklet and is quite hard to find. Note that the Scott catalogue values the 1956 issue as a pane only. 2022 Scott US$340=	$425.00	$75.00
2253
200	France #Q3/Q214. Extensive all mint H/NH high quality collection of Parcel Post (Colis Postaux) stamps, 1892 to 1945 period issues.

201	France - 52 early mint hinged including #118, 121-125, 127-130, set #156-184, set 185-196, 294. VG-VF centred, some have hinge gum thins but most look like sound examples. Seldom see these mint! 2022 Scott US$ 675.00=	$843.75	$80.00
5016
202	France - 63 different very early issues used, 1849 - 1898, mounted on album pages in hingeless mounts. Look to be nice condition, and the high value imperforate Ceres heads have nice margins. Identified by owner, with owner‚Äôs 2022 Scott US$ 1796.00=	$2,245.00	$200.00

203	France - Air Mail Exposition Cinderellas. Exceptional group of "La Poste Aerienne" labels and imperf label trial colour proofs issued in conjunction with the 1943 Paris Philatelic Exposition. The lot consists of gummed and perforated panes of four labels in four different colours (black, claret, blue green and blue) with matching colour imperforate panes of four. A cover with the commemorative show cancel and label affixed also accompanies. The aircraft depicted on the labels (and cancel) is most certainly a French manufacture Caudron C445 Goeland twin engined utility aircraft and the view of Paris depicted on the labels is nearly identical the view on #C22, the 1947 issue 500fr French air mail stamp! Attending a stamp show in Paris during the WWII German occupation must have been an odd experience, to say the least. Note: production of the C445 resumed after the war. All in all this is a great lot for the aerophilatelist, stamp exposition ephemera collector or WWII enthusiast. Well worth further research. Estimate=	$200.00	$55.00
3613
204	France - Gros Chiffres and Petits Chiffres Cancel Collection/Accumulation of classic French issues, all acquired for the "Gros Chiffres" or "Petit Chiffres" numeral cancels.

All valued by the owner using Scott catalogue only. While faults can be expected in a lot of this type, better cancels will certainly be lurking in the mix. Owner's 2020 Scott US$4,189.00=	$5,236.25	$180.00
5977
205	France - Mint semi-postal collection of 288 different between 1927 and 1957, only missing a very few! Mounted on hingeless album pages, but most are hinged. A spectacular collection of seldom seen semi-postals, nearly complete for the period. Each stamp not inspected, so could be the minor gum fault, but did notice some NH upon a random check. Big catalogue value here represents their scarcity. 2022 Scott US$ 1812.00 =	$2,265.00	$325.00
29
206	French Polynesia #560-562. VF mint NH complete gutter panes of ten of the 1991 issue high value "18th Century Scenes" set of three. The key 68fr value is very scarce. 2022 Scott US$530.00=	$662.50	$85.00

269
209	French Southern and Antarctic Territories #25-28 27A. Archivally fresh and pristine mint NH 1966-1969 issue "Flora and Fauna" set of five. The key 20fr "Black-browed Albatross" high value is particularly nice. 2022 Scott US$357.50=	$446.88	$160.00
269
210	French Southern and Antarctic Territories #C6, C12, C16a, C17.. Choice quality fresh and VF mint NH quartet of 1963 to 1969 period airmail issues, consisting of three high value single issues and one triptych.

212	Ghana #41a/698. All VF mint and almost all NH selection of 32 different 1959 to 1979 period souvenir sheets. While stamps from this period are relatively easy to find, the souvenir sheets are surprisingly elusive. Can't have a modern formerly British Africa collection without the sheets! Great topicals also. See the inventory list for full details. 2021 Scott US$110.10=	$137.62	$46.00
4997

A very clean and comprehensive offering! 2021 Scott US$273.00=	$341.25	$42.00
5602
215	Great Britain #1, 1a. Used examples of the black and intense black shades of the 1840 issue "Penny Black". The #1 has a red Maltese Cross cancel, a light horizontal crease and small nick at left, the #1a has a black Maltese Cross cancel and a light crease at bottom. Unchecked for plate numbers. Still a nice looking shade duo. 2021 Scott Classic US$900.00=	$1,125.00	$170.00

6103
217	Great Britain #5. VF looking used example of the 1847 issue 1sh pale green embossed imperf with vertical silk threads. Margins well clear on all sides. Small thins and some splitting along the vertical silk security thread do not detract from the much nicer than usual appearance of this difficult early high value imperf. 2022 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,250.00	$75.00
6001
218	Great Britain #9/126. All used collection of 72 different Victorian era stamps (1841-1900 period issues), all laid out on two Hagner brand stock sheets with each stamp individually identified and valued. Generally in sound and F/VF condition (but the odd fault can be expected), this group will fill over half the spaces in the pre-1900 section of your GB album. Unchecked for cancels or varieties, offered as received. Owner's 2020 Scott US$6,630.00=	$8,287.50	$325.00
5977
219	Great Britain #34/82 on Cover. Clean and high quality group of nine different 1860s to 1880s period covers/folded letters, all addressed to France, either to Paris or Nice. The single frankings include Scott #34, 61 (plates 12, 13 and 15), 62 (plate 13), 67 (plates 3 and 5) and 82 (plates 22 and 23).

6060
220	Great Britain #57. Well centered used example of the 1867 5 shilling rose QV high value, plate 1, watermark 26 (Maltese Cross).

3266

6060
222	Great Britain #92. VF appearing used example of the extremely rare 1882 issue ONE POUND Victoria high value, brown lilac on bluish paper, watermark 31 (anchor). The stamp originally had a commercial perfin ("HSB" running vertically at left) that has been expertly filled in. Scott footnotes add a 25% premium for margins clear of design on all sides as well as a 50% premium for a clear circular datestamp. Missing from most collections in any condition. 2022 Scott US$17,500 =	$21,875.00	$1,025.00
1837
223	Great Britain #169a. F/VF mint NH sheet margin block of the 1917 printing of the GeoV 8p Black on buff "granite" paper. Listed in SG Concise as #391 @ ¬£60.00 each (= ¬£240.00 for the block = $408.00 CDN). 2021 Scott Classic for NH US$250.00=	$312.50	$55.00

6108
225	Great Britain - #1 to Recent. A Meaty Remaindered Collection in 2 Volumes. The balance of a substantial mostly used GB collection of hundreds with lots of prime meat still left on the bones. The lot begins with a used #1 and while there are not many pound values present, the sets often contain the 10sh values. Lots of Victorian era high values noted in the mix. Some faults to be expected in an offering of this type but it has not been checked for better cancels, plates or varieties. The total catalogue value will be in the thousands. Estimate=	$750.00	$525.00
5742
226	Great Britain - Box Lot Bonanza. Smallish carton packed with modern GB material, including several dozen FDCs (SG Concise cat over ¬£200.00), over ¬£30.00 mint face value (mostly ¬£3 Wedgwood booklets), a quantity of PHQ cards, the balance of a used Machin collection and sundry other items. Estimate =	$120.00	$80.00
6060
227	Great Britain - Offices in the Turkish Empire #55-64. Almost all mint Hinged (#63 is used) complete set of 1921 issue 30pa to 180pi overprints on ¬Ωp to 10sh GeoV issues of GB. This is the last overprinted set issued. 2022 Scott US$122.85=	$153.56	$28.00
3266
228	Greece #RA40. Sound used example of the 1917 "Corfu" Postal Tax issue 20 lepta surcharge on 50 lepta blue. Scott notes that "counterfeits exist, used". Mint examples of this stamp catalogue higher. Sold "as is". 2021 Scott US$1,075.00=	$1,343.75	$24.00
6008
229	Guyana #24/309. All VF mint NH selection of 222 almost all different 1966 to 1979 period stamps and one miniature pane. Great topicals. Not missing much to be a complete run. 2022 Scott US$144.30=	$180.38	$42.00
5495
230	Hong Kong #8/116 Plus "Back of the Book". Collection of 46 almost all used 1863 to 1914 period postal issues plus another 9 revenues/non-Scott listed items. All still Hinged on the original album pages. Some small faults to be expected in an original "old-time" group such as this but unchecked for better cancels or other varieties, with only the Scott listed items valued. Consignor's 2021 Scott US$482.30=	$602.88	$110.00
3820
231	Hong Kong #8/69. Almost all used selection of 42 mostly different 1863 to 1898 period issues, all laid out and identified by the consignor on one Hagner brand stock sheet. Seven obviously faulty stamps have been identified but not valued in the total. Very decent range of treaty port and other better cancels noted in the mix, but the entire lot is valued by basic Scott catalogue. The revenues are unpriced. Owner's 2019 Scott US$913.00=	$1,141.25	$160.00
6246
232	Hong Kong #275-288, 388-403. Two choice quality QEII long high value definitive sets, both VF mint NH and Post Office fresh. The lot consists of the 1973 issue set of 14 and the 1982 set of 16. Carefully stored since they were issued, these stamps will make welcome additions to any modern British Commonwealth or Elizabethan collection. 2022 Scott US$193.55=	$241.94	$85.00
5734
233	Iceland #5/201, C3, O16, O24, O35. Fifty-two stamps from the 1873-1937 period in used or MH condition. Note that the #5 (catalogue US$1,450.00) has been carefully scrutinized (by the consignor) and appears to be properly printed, with correct perf gauge and the usual irregular perfs, with offset centering typical of the issue. However, the paper is heavier and off-colour, with no watermark than that normally associated with the issue. It is quite possible that this is a genuine anomaly but would take much more research to confirm. Consequently, we offer it as is and have not included any value for it in our totals. Apart from this the best stamps in the lot are #10, 12, 15, 74 (mint), and C3. Owner's 2019 Scott US$450.75=	$563.44	$120.00
5977
234	Iceland #152-162, 195-201, 203-216, 236, 246-252.. Gorgeous selection of all mint H/NH 1930 to 1948 period issues. The 1930 "Millenary" issues go up to the 40a value but the rest of the lot is all top quality complete sets. 2022 Scott US$474.25=	$592.81	$120.00
163
235	Indian States: Soruth #O19. "On piece" used example of the 1 Anna on ¬Ω Anna dark blue and black "Gir Lion" with manuscript "SARKARI" ("SERVICE" in Gujarati) in carmine, cancelled with the proper "UNA - SEP 18 '49" CDS cancel. 2021 Scott Classic US$225.00=	$281.25	$85.00
4858
236	Iraq #221, 224. Unissued (unoverprinted). Mint NH 1957-1958 unissued 40 fils orange brown and 100 fils orange King Faisal II designs (Scott design type A33). These two stamps are lacking the 2-line "Republic" overprints in Arabic. The consignor notes that they estimate that there are fewer than 200 examples of each in existence. Estimate =	$120.00	$36.00
1858
237	Ireland #15-18, 47-150, 161-168, J14.. Clean and all NH selection of 17 different stamps, ranging from 1922 overprints up to 1950s commemorative sets, plus one solitary postage due. 2022 Scott US$269.30=	$336.62	$60.00

5742
243	Italy #27. Sound and Fine (small) part OG Hinged example of the 1863 issue 10c buff Victor Emmanuel definitive. A very rare stamp in mint condition (and may even be the better de la Rue printing).2021 Scott US$3,100.00=	$3,875.00	$260.00
4827
244	Italy #47. Fresh and Fine mint full never hinged original gum example of the rare 1879 twenty centesimi orange King Humbert I issue. A small area of natural uneven gum application (common on early Italy) noted for the record. Great colour and perfs, with the usual centering for this issue. 2021 Scott Classic catalogue US$950 =	$1,187.50	$55.00
5038
245	Italy #290-305. VF mint LH 1932 "10th Anniversary of the Fascist Government and the March on Rome" set of 16. Extremely fresh and attractive issues, very evocative imagery from the Fascist period of Italian governance. 2021 Scott US$182.85=	$228.56	$55.00
3788
246	Italy # 310-314. VF CDS used complete 1933 "Holy Year" set of five. 2022 Scott US$248.00=	$310.00	$55.00

250	Italy - Saseno #1-8. Sound, fresh and Fine mint Hinged complete run of all eight 1923 overprinted Italian issues, slated for use on the Albanian islet occupied by the Italians between 1914 and 1947. Don't think we've handled this set before. 2021 Scott US$260.00=	$325.00	$65.00

6124
254	Netherlands Colonies - Netherlands Colonies Collection on Minkus Pages. Very helpfully filled Minkus album with pages to around 1970. The colonies represented are Netherlands Antilles - Curacao, Netherlands Indies, early Indonesia, Netherlands New Guinea and Surinam. While none of these individual collections are by any means complete, there are better sets and singles throughout. A nice thing about this lot is that it covers what I consider to be the interesting historical period of these colonies. Hundreds of different stamps, probably with a pretty decent catalogue value total. Estimate =	$200.00	$240.00
2951
255	Netherlands Antilles #1/365,B1/B133,C1/C45,CB13/CB36,J11/J57. Mint H/NH and used collection of 578 different stamps and 3 souvenir sheets, ranging for the first issues of 1873 up to 1974.

5660

Unusually fresh and VF mint NH or postally used selection of 25 different 1945-1949 period issues from the short-lived autonomous formerly Indian state. Some of these stamps are surprisingly hard to find, in no small part due to the very short time period that these were valid issues. What were once "all different" sample packs now catalogue US$96.50 per pack of 25! This lot contains 10 packs. A perfect acquisition for the Ebay or show seller. 2022 Scott US$965.00=	$1,206.25	$75.00
4877
268	Rhodesia #26/128. Mint and used lightly duplicated selection of 93 stamps, 1896-1923 period issues. The lot is laid out on four Hagner brand stock sheets, all identified and priced by the original owner quite some time ago. If the prices on the tags (in both dollars and pounds) are catalogue values, there have been significant increases in value since the stamps were priced. The group includes "Coat of Arms", "Double Heads" and "Admiral" issues. A great lot for the British Africa specialist. Significant total catalogue value, especially if redone by a present-day catalogue. The four scans of the lot are worth a good study. Estimate =	$325.00	$400.00

60	Canada #104. TRIMBLE MAJOR RE-ENTRY 2. CDS used 1c green GeoV Admiral, plate #7 UR position 6, showing a clear example of the re-entry described by Ralph Trimble on his "re-entries.com" site as: "This major exhibits a shift in the lower portion of the design, with lovely doubling of both 1's, much of ONE CENT, the bottom frameline and right vertical frameline. All of the spandrel lines above the RNB are doubled into the white frame". While not as eye-catching as the Unitrade listed #104xii ($1,500.00 for Fine used), it may very well be just as scarce. The small portion of the sheet margin at top shows a part of the "No #7" plate inscription, provving beyond a doubt the plate number and position of this constant Admiral variety.

Strangely only listed in Unitrade as singles (no pair or corner block price?). Very conservatively valued as four T1 error singles. 2022 Unitrade	$240.00	$65.00
6035
93	Canada #711. REPELLEX ERROR. VF MNH complete field stock (non-inscripted) pane of 100 of the 10c 'Lady's Slipper' Floral definitive issue, with an astounding swath of missing colour down the ENTIRE ninth column. These printing errors occured due to a spillage of cleaning fluid (trade name Repellex) designed to prevent the buildup of excess ink on the rollers. The missing colour progresses as you descend the column from approximately 10% to 90% of the individual stamps, and there is also a slight misregistration of printed colours on all stamps noted. Estimate =	$500.00	$230.00
6035
94	Canada #1431a. Substantial investment/dealer lot of 60 x VF mint NH 1992 issue Canada Day se-tenant panes of 12 x 42c stamps (plus 13 labels). The total face value of the sheets is $302.40 but these usually wholesale for considerably higher than face value. A superior quality group, without the usual bends or edge faults often seen with these large format sheets. 2022 Unitrade	$1,800.00	$210.00
6035
95	Canada #1764b. VF MNH example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2022 Unitrade	$500.00	$120.00
4961
96	Canada #1991C-1991D, 2045-2048, 2063-2064. Three part VF mint NH package of scarcer modern issues, consisting of: #1 Complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheet. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle; #2 The 2004 issue "Ring Me, Write Me" set of four, each stamp removed from the folder but still on the original backing (valued as one half pane of 2); and #3 Both of the 2004 issue undenominated (49c at time of issue) Maple Leaf in Frame "Picture Postage"¬ù panes of 21. Post Office fresh and VF+ MNH. These "Picture Postage" stamps were available at some post offices with this generic maple leaf design but could also be specially ordered with personalized photographs in the vignette. Another modern "sleeper"¬ù issue, as we also don't often find these sheets in collections we handle. 2022 Unitrade	$270.00	$120.00
6024
97	Canada #2015, 2016. Artist Signed Quartet. VF condition artist signed (Anita Kunz) group of four different 2004 "Year of the Monkey" Lunar New Year items, consisting of a full mint NH pane of 25 x 49c stamps, the $1.40 souvenir sheet and Canada Post cacheted FDCs of the $1.40 souvenir sheet and 49c single. These signed items were not regularly available but could only be acquired at Canada Post "stamp launch" events. Estimate =	$120.00	$55.00
5604
98	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing a souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly (impossible to find) and dog (almost as hard to find) thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. These sets have and will increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. An additional set of cards is included in the lot, missing the stamps but still including the 15-minute phone cards and white mailing envelopes. Valued for the complete stamp/phone card and envelope packs only. 2022 Unitrade	$200.00	$130.00
5456
99	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$400.00	$160.00
870
100	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Ten archival quality VF MNH complete sets of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2021 Unitrade	$650.00	$200.00
6035
101	Canada #2586. Canada Post THANKS/MERCI! Picture Postage. Two VF condition intact mint examples of the VERY limited edition booklet of 12 of the Permanent "THANKS/MERCI!" Truck and Rainbow design Picture Postage stamp, issued on November 30th 2020, ONLY TO CANADA POST EMPLOYEEES. These booklets are very elusive and this is the first time we've ever offered any for sale. While recognized and reviewed in numerous philatelic journals, Unitrade has yet to create an individual listing for this stamp, so we have used the Unitrade catalogue number for the frame design as our reference. Two booklets are perfect for display purposes (front and back). Estimate=	$150.00	$375.00
5115
102	Canada #2951i. VF mint NH example of the 2016 issue $1.80 Steve Yzerman from the NHL "Great Canadian Forwards" series, AUTOGRAPHED by Steve Yzerman. The stamp/card has the proper silver reflective Canada Post hologram. Only 500 produced. Yzerman was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, his first year of eligibility. Note that sports memorabilia sites usually sell these stamps for well over the Unitrade catalogue value, which remains italicized to indicate a rough estimate only. Estimate	$300.00	$525.00
5028
103	Canada #BK32d/BK53. F/VF mint selection of 22 different intact booklets, 1942 to 1967 period issues. Each booklet has a small strip of "Post-it-Note" lightly affixed for identification purposes. The booklets all are identified by the McCann numbering system (almost like Unitrade) and the prices match Unitrade in most cases. See the scan of the inventory spreadsheet for more details. Owner's Unitrade/McCann	$462.00	$120.00
5595
104	Canada #BK106-BK109. Two complete sets of four VF condition intact mint NH 1989 issue Christmas booklets consisting of the 33c ($3.30), 38c ($3.80), 44c ($2.20) and 76c ($3.80) value booklets. These are a particularly scarce series of booklets. Nice to have two sets in order to display the covers as well as the panes themselves. 2022 Unitrade	$284.00	$42.00
4302
105	Canada #C1/CE3, CO1-CO2, EO1-EO2, O1/O49, O231/OCE1.

Lots of VF stamps in the mix! 2021 Scott Classic US$1,124.85=	$1,406.06	$95.00
6012
108	Canada #CP19i-CP23i. Post Office Fresh MNH ERROR strip of 8 of the Permanent-denominated Computer Vended Postage 'kiosk' stamp pane from 2016, with Vancouver post office code 105341 at the beginning of the digit string. Error strips of longer than the usual 5 stamps are very rare and usually include a label or two without printing; to have such a long strip with all stamps printed is exceptionally rare. This error strip has been carefully set aside since the original purchase more than 5 years ago. Errors on this first issue of these kiosk stamps were wildly popular in the secondary market from a very early stage and we wouldn't be surprised if a detailed study were to be published in the future. Estimate	$500.00	$95.00
870
109	Canada #CP19i-CP38i. Post Office Fresh MNH set of Computer Vended Postage 'kiosk' stamp panes of 5 different designs from 2016, of all four denominations current at the time (Permanent, $1.20, $1.80 and $2.50), plus 3 error strips as dispensed by the machine. Strips have the Vancouver post office code 105341 at the beginning of the digit string. The error strips have been carefully set aside since the original purchase more than 5 years ago, with the top 3 stamps of $1.20 misplaced with 2 stuck in perfect alignment to the right on one strip, miscut strip of 4 and a half stamps of $1.80 (obviously this could be faked but this is a genuine kiosk error), and short strip of 4 with the top label blank. On the back side of the $1.80 strip of 4 is a spot of adhesive glue (which is why the glassine is backing it) which could mean that the stamps were from the end of the roll and thus an error occurred in the printing. Errors on this first issue of these kiosk stamps were wildly popular in the secondary market from a very early stage and we wouldn't be surprised if a detailed study were to be published in the future. Estimate	$200.00	$130.00
870

132	Canada Cancels - BC British Columbia - Curnow BC 1906 Split Ring on Edward 2c Pair on small cut square.

Still mounted on an original Alex Price album page (folded) which also features a map of the area and a 1906 letter written and signed by the Curnow Postmaster / storekeeper. A scarcity for the BC collector, as the post office was only open for 5 months between Nov 1st, 1905 to April 1st, 1906. There was only $49.00 of Post Office revenue at the Curnow P.O, with the Postmaster‚Äôs salary being $10.42. A very interesting historical BC item, being one of only two know examples. Estimate =	$140.00	$825.00

6035
135	Canada Covers #17b. Cents Issue 10c value, posted from Gananoque UC (Ontario) on May 26th, 1864 to Detroit, Michigan with original letter enclosed.

Very unusual to see a proper one cent "unsealed letter" franking (in addition to the CL25c) paid with an "in period" 1c orange MacDonald from the 1927 Confederation set. While the envelope does not contain the original letter, there is a note from Major Dick Malott, dated 1969, which describes the this cover and Canadian semi-postal useage to the buyer. Much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. 2022 Unitrade	$175.00	$60.00
5444

6108
207	Great Britain #18, 20. Unpicked used accumulation of 212 stamps on pages of the 1856-58 issue perforated Penny Red, including pairs and a strip of 3. Stupendous range of shades and cancels. Good chance of finding better perfs, re-entries, etc. - careful inspection will certainly be rewarded. Valued as the lowest Scott catalogue value for #20.

6060
209	Great Britain #33. Plate Number Collection. Nearly complete collection of Penny Red plates (no #77 or #225) all in used condition. Still hinged on the original Stanley Gibbons album pages. Some faults to be expected in an old-time group such as this but unchecked for watermark varieties, plate flaws or cancels. A good start to reconstructing full sheets of each plate! 2022 Scott US$1,394.00=	$1,742.50	$140.00
5841
210	Great Britain #49. Complete Plates. Complete run of plates #4 through #10 of the 1867 issue 3p rose, wmk 25 (Spray of Rose). All F/VF used, the odd small fault. Nice to get all the different plates at once. 2022 Scott US$767.50=	$959.38	$110.00
6108
211	Great Britain #53. INVERTED WATERMARK. Sound used example of the 1867 issue 10p red brown, with watermark 25 (Spray of Rose) INVERTED. Unlisted in Scott, this classic variety is listed in Stanley Gibbons Concise as #112Wi @ ¬£1,000.00 SG Concise ¬£1,000.00=	$1,730.00	$120.00

2763
213	Great Britain #58. Plate #1 Block. Used block of four of the 1870 issue ¬Ωp rose "Bantam", plate #1.

3634
214	Great Britain #58. PLATE #9. Sound and Fine used example of the RARE PLATE 9 of the 1870 issue ¬Ωp rose "Bantam" still tied to piece by a barred duplex cancel. Of particular note on this stamp is the unusual sharpness and clarity of printing as well as the fact that the cancel is well clear of the plate number. Unquestionably a plate 9! 2022 Scott US$850.00=	$1,062.50	$220.00
4318

3773
216	Great Britain #65. Sound, fresh and VF centered used example of the 1880 issue 1 shilling salmon Victoria, plate 13.

While the odd fault is to be expected, you will appreciate the accuracy and detailed effort made by the collector to properly classify this group.

A couple of minor faults noted for the record (shallow thin and 2 tiny pinholes). MUCH scarce than the catalogue value ($375.00 to $800.00) would suggest (the 20 year old retail price was $525.00).

37	Canada #34/286b, C5/O49. Huge duplicated mint all used 1870s to 1960s period Canadian stock of easily over 1800 stamps in five sales binders. While there are no particularly high catalogue value single items, and some faults are to be expected, there are enough nice $5.00-$10.00 items here to make this the perfect research lot or used material "stock refresher" for the online or show dealer.

5010
51	Canada #51/102. All mint selection of late Queen Victoria and Edward VII 1897-1908 period issues. Mostly OG Hinged (the odd NH and regummed stamp also noted in the mix). Expect the odd small fault in an offering of this type. 2022 Scott US$4,058.00=	$5,072.50	$425.00

A staggering total of 1387 blocks (5548 stamps), all in MNH condition. A fairly comprehensive representation for this period, with heavy duplication to be expected.

5595
207	Great Britain #1. Decent looking but faulty (pinhole) used example of the 1840 issue "Penny Black", the world's first stamp. Identified as plate 1b.

4247
209	Great Britain #2. Used example of the 1840 issue 2p blue imperf. Black Maltese Cross cancel. Margins large to just in. Light crease running through and just below "POSTAGE" at top.

6246
210	Great Britain #4/Recent Mini-Hoard. Sometimes heavily duplicated used accumulation hundreds of 1840s to 1990s period issues, all laid out in one stock book. While there are no multi-$100 catalogue stamps in the mix, there are enough medium value items and variety to interest the general collector, specialist and dealer.

3266
211	Great Britain #5. VF looking used example of the 1847 issue 1sh pale green embossed imperf with vertical silk threads. Margins well clear on all sides.

6060
212	Great Britain #7. VARIETY Used example of the 1854 issue embossed 6p red violet, with "VR" watermark (wmk 19) INVERTED AND REVERSED (SG #60Wk @ ¬£1,000.00).

This particular stamp has a very clearly printed design, with a very legible and definite "225" plate marking (not usually the case), with the cancel well clear of the right hand plate number. Missing from most collections we see. Here's your chance to get a premium quality stamp to complete your plate set. 2022 Scott US$825.00=	$1,031.25	$270.00
4178
215	Great Britain #87 Plates 13 & 14. Sound and F/VF used examples of the 1sh salmon, 1880 (plate 13) and 1881 (plate 14) printings. Nice to get them both at once, especially this nice. 2022 Scott US$330.00=	$412.50	$90.00

231	Great Britain - 140 different modern 2003-2018 used + one souvenir sheet. All in pairs or strips or blocks (thus rare used).

Very fresh mint collection of 1935-1981 issues neatly housed in a large 48 page (24 double sided) stockbook, with each NH stamp carefully placed in a mount and arranged on the pages. Unfortunately storing the stamps in the mounts glazed the gum and this appears to have affected all of the stamps with shiny gum arabic (in use well into the 1970's). Total face value of the over 850 stamps is $103.88. 2022 Scott US$871.85 =	$1,089.81	$110.00

Fairly complete for the time period of 1939-1979 but missing the high values of the War issue, the entire Peace issue, Fisheries dollar and the odd stamp here and there. Total face value of lot is $81.71. Appears to be almost all NH although the earlier pages are the old school mounts and hard to check for hinging.

6221
79	Canada #295. Complete roll of 500 of the 1c green KGVI 1949 issue, with full start and end strips of 10 blank tabs.

4671
82	Canada #325/1076. Part One of a MNH collection, 1953-1985 issues neatly mounted in a red Lighthouse padded deluxe album with slipcase. High degree of completion for the period with some room for development still. Generally not checked for varieties or fluorescences, but at a glance noticed a 1-bar tag error on book pane #945a. Would have a huge catalogue value considering the first page has QEII Karsh issue coil pairs and continues from there; conservatively valued by the usable postage only. Face	$196.94	$190.00
6108
83	Canada #351,362, 363, 372.

No 1970 or 1972 issues, with the other 1970's issues present only as mint and used sets of singles. All mint stamps assumed to be NH. Also includes some parallel used material as well as cut-down Bileski album pages and sets. Total face value alone is $71.64. 2021 Unitrade	$1,027.00	$85.00

5595
94	Canada #790. DRAMATIC MIS-PERF. Mint NH block of 15 of the 1979 issue 17c green Houses of Parliament definitive, dramatically mis-perforated horizontally. While the image is well off centre, the phosphor tagging is still aligned with the perforations. Unitrade lists the value of this type of mis-perf at $50-$60 each (see the "Errors, Freaks and Oddities" section of the catalogue introduction). Note that this block is from the left hand side of the sheet. Some minor perf separations from folding. Unitrade value	$750.00	$140.00
870
95	Canada #839 T1.

5070
97	Canada #1077/1760b. Part Two of a MNH collection, 1986-1998 issues neatly mounted in a green Lighthouse padded deluxe album with slipcase.

6175
100	Canada #1283a-1286b. Four complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c four season "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special short-term promotion for Petro Canada. All still come with the original return post cards and envelopes in which they were given out at service stations. Getting hard to find, especially with the original packaging intact. 2021 Unitrade	$200.00	$48.00
6012
101	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH example of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. 2021 Unitrade	$100.00	$160.00
6175
102	Canada #1764b. VF MNH right hand sheet margin example (proving beyond a doubt that it is the "sheet form" variety and not a reperforated booklet stamp) of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2021 Unitrade	$500.00	$150.00
6175
103	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Note that a sheet recently sold for $550.00 in an unreserved auction! Estimate	$400.00	$250.00
6175
104	Canada #2844, 2847a (BK623). Rare VF mint NH examples of both versions of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" stamps, consisting of the $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo" and the complete self-adhesive booklet pane of 6 containing two $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoos". The souvenir sheet is particularly hard to find and often sells for over full catalogue. 2021 Unitrade	$300.00	$450.00
5726
105	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$85.00
6175
106	Canada #3064i. Used example (tied to a small piece) newly Unitrade listed "Missing red P" error. Slightly clipped corner noted for the record. Another normal used stamp included for comparison. Unitrade 2021 notes two used copies reported. This would be a new addition. No evidence of any tampering to remove the P. 2021 Unitrade	$1,250.00	$290.00
6175
107	Canada #BK54-BK71. Huge collection/accumulation of complete mint Centennial issue booklets, not often offered in such desirable quality or quantity. A total of 278 booklets neatly housed on 39 pages, the vast majority being Vario stockpages either black or clear. A highlight is a spectacular misperf error on BK71 (similar to that listed as BK71e T2 in the Adminware database) with the vertical perforations shifted 3mm to left resulting in a G2aL tagging error at left. Noted many varieties, as would be expected for this interesting issue, but not all identified and so catalogued conservatively as the cheapest variety in some cases (like BK54 and BK69). Total face value of the usable postage is $125.98. 2021 Unitrade	$3,476.25	$725.00
5595
108	Canada #BK72a/BK87. Fresh collection/accumulation of complete and intact booklets from the Christmas 1968 issue to the Canadian Forts of 1983 and 1985.

A total 283 booklets with a usable face value of $149.20. 2021 Unitrade	$632.00	$350.00
4249

4249
113	Canada #BK96b var. Two complete sets of 10 booklets with different covers, with panes showing a distinctive "Smoke in Sky" variety on both 6c henna brown stamps.
