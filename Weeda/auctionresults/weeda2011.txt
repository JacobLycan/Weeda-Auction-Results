4462
24	Canada #30d. Used example of one of the rarest Large Queen varieties - the 1876 issue 15c with Pirie script watermark. Many experts consider this stamp to be second as a Large Queen rarity only to the 2c on laid paper. This is the nicest example of this key classic I've ever handled. Other than one expertly repaired short perf at LR this stamp is sound and very rare thus. Ex "Greenway" collection and Saskatoon Stamp. Wonderfully written up on a hand illustrated exhibit page. Don't hesitate on this one, it will be some time before you get another chance. 2011 Scott US$5,500.00=	$5,500.00	$1,600.00
