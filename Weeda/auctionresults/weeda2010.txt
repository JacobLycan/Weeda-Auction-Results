The consignor paid multiples of catalogue value for these stamps and compared to the average quality of most of these early issues, these are superb.

4005
85	Canada #1634i. Uncut press sheet of six panes, SIGNED, of the 1997 issue Birds of Canada. Some small creases along two edges.

4148
87	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes.
