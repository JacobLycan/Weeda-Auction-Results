Very comprehensive for the period, with lots of material not usually seen in more basic collections. All neatly mounted (mostly in black Hawid type mounts) on printed Minkus Cambodia album pages. These early Cambodian issues are some of the prettiest engraved stamps of the 20th century. Excellent topicals. Owner's 2014 Scott US$1,379.95=	$1,379.95	$375.00

5165
19	Canada #4d. VF appearing used example of the 3p red beaver 1852 pence issue imperf on thin wove paper. Nice 7-ring target cancel in blue.

Generally F-VF used (mostly CDS cancels) collection of 1859-2004 period issues, all hinged on Scott Canada and blank album pages. 2,763 stamps, 6 souvenir sheets/miniature panes and 1 booklet pane total. The collection has only been catalogued up to the end of 1951 but there will be a decent amount of additional value in the recent material also. Saw some paper and plate varieties in the uncatalogued material. Very conservatively valued. Some light duplication noted but the collector had a good eye for quality stamps. Very comprehensive from the Small Queens up. 2014 Scott US$2,250.00=	$2,250.00	$210.00

Mixed condition (expect faults) but noted lots of potentially better shades and cancels. The owner has catalogued all the Small Queens as basic (cheapest) types and has not valued the Large Queens. Owner's total Unitrade cat as Fine used.	$649.00	$160.00
3266
30	Canada #35-42. Mostly VF Specialized used collection on three double sided stocksheets (5 sides) with 190 stamps including shades and perf 11.5 x 12, including #38a (x 7) and 39a (x 15).

4746
32	Canada #41vi plus extras. VF used 3c Small Queen showing a very strong and definite example of the "Vampire Bite" constant plate flaw as well as an additional trio of 3c Small Queens showing what could be called "Vampire Nibbles". The flaw on one of the additional stamps is most probably an inking flaw but the "neck nibbles" on the other two additional stamps appear to come from minor plate damage. An exceptional lot for the Small Queen aficionado. Valued for the one true "Vampire Bite" stamp only. 2013 Unitrade.	$250.00	$110.00
2740
33	Canada #43. VF mint Hinged example of the 1889 issue red brown shade of the 6c Small Queen (Ottawa printing). Perf 11.9 x 11.9. Using the Stanley Gibbons colour guide it comes up as lake brown.

4178
41	Canada #71, 72. Fresh and F-VF used blocks of four of the 1897 issue 6c brown and 8c orange QV "Leafs". Elusive and attractive used multiples of a very short-lived Victorian series. 2014 Scott US$190.00=	$190.00	$65.00
4443

3398
69	Canada #1991C, 1991D. Two se-tenant blocks of four of the scarce 2003 Canada-Alaska cruise Picture Postage tourist issue plus the illustrated panel. These short-lived issues are missing from most collections we see and quite undervalued in Unitrade. 2013 Unitrade.	$80.00	$60.00

91	Canada Cancels - Clear and nearly complete strike of the extremely rare 1901 "PROVINCIAL EXHIBITION VICTORIA OCT 1. TO 5" slogan flag cancel (Coutts #P-785) on a horizontal pair of 2c QV "Numeral" issues. This very early slogan is only known on a couple of dozen favour cancelled covers and on a handful of used stamps. It is theorized that this cancelling device was very annoying to use so the postal employees in the Victoria post office "misplaced" it after only a week or so of use. Coutts catalogue lists the value of this cancel on cover at $850.00. The lot comes with a photocopy of a very informative 1953 "Maple Leaves" article on the cancel by the well known Victoria stamp dealer, Reg Nairne. This is the "Holy Grail" of Canadian slogan/flag cancels. Estimate	$250.00	$230.00

18	British Commonwealth - Mostly older, useful, varied and valuable mint and used stock of 1,769 stamps, early Queen Victoria through QEII period issues, all laid out in two stockbooks.

2299
26	Canada #1. Fresh, sound and Fine lightly cancelled (7 ring target) used example of the 1851 issue 3p Beaver imperf on horizontally laid paper.

5026
27	Canada #15. Fresh and F-VF mint example of the 1859 issue 5c Beaver. Sharp detailed impression and deep rich colour. The hinged gum looks good but is most probably not original. Comes with the album page on which the owner has noted printing details. A sound and attractive stamp. 2014 Scott US$525.00=	$525.00	$150.00
3590

4852
31	Canada #26. Used example of the 5c olive green Large Queen. The stamp appears at first glance to be mint OG but the 2013 Vincent Graves Greene pink photo certificate sets the matter straight stating "used, stained, cleaned and regummed". The attempted "restoration" of this stamp to mint condition (Scott cat US$2,000.00) is actually an expert job and could fool many a collector and dealer. A lesser expertization service than VGG might have come to a different conclusion. A great reference item. 2014 Scott as used US$225.00=	$225.00	$70.00
