4034
71	Canada #540/540ii. VF MNH field stock (with the inscriptions trimmed off) pane of 50 of the 1971 issue 6c Samuel Hearne commemorative, all positions showing "Ghost print" doubling of the red which is particularly strong on column 4, in addition to having the "Scratch beside south spoke" varieties at position 1 (long line), 13 (medium line), Unitrade's position xx) and 41 AND 46 (short lines which almost always occur at both positions on the same pane). Rarely do you see such lovely doubling on this closely spaced variety. 2020 Unitrade.	$2,000.00	$210.00
5459
72	Canada #572ii. Scarce VF MNH full "field stock" pane of 50 of the 1974 issue 8c Pacific Coast Indians (with blank corners, as always found), showing the completely "missing bird on the totem" error at position 28 (the centre stamp in the right half block of 25). A superb positional showpiece of a popular modern error. 2020 Unitrade.	$268.00	$110.00
5459
73	Canada #599, 599a, 600. VF mint matched sets of three different types of the $1.00 "Vancouver". 2020 Unitrade.	$280.00	$75.00

5705
75	Canada #766ai. VF mint NH pane of 50 of the 1978 issue 14c Natural Resources commemorative on the much brighter Unitrade listed MF paper. The pane is folded in half along the perfs with some paper discolouration noted at the top of the pane. 2020 Unitrade.	$665.00	$65.00
5459

5427
79	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$60.00
4780
80	Canada #1362c. Mint NH imperforate pair of the 1998 issue 45c "Flag over Building" definitive. (design size 16mm x 20mm). Wrinkles/light creases noted (many of these errors have bad creases and other major faults). A much nicer than usual pair. 2020 Unitrade.	$750.00	$75.00
4901
81	Canada #1407ai (x 2). Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from the "CANADA 92" international stamp exhibition. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00
6008
82	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH example of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

5281
83	Canada #1698b. VF mint NH imperforate vertical pair of the 1998 issue 46c "Flag over Iceberg" booklet stamp (from BK215). A nice little showpiece. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$95.00
982
84	Canada #1764b. VF MNH lower right plate inscription pair of the extremely rare 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the sheet form perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. Great to get this particular perf variety like this because it guarantees that it comes from a sheet and isn't a reperfed booklet pair. 2019 Unitrade.	$1,000.00	$525.00
6008
85	Canada #1818-1834 (Thematic Collection #88).

3613
87	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00
5389
88	Canada #2201a. The 2007 issue 52c "Year of the Pig" missing gold error in VF MNH condition. This was that year's major error. We have seen these sell on eBay for up to $900.00 US each (back in the day). Normal stamp included for comparison. 2020 Unitrade.	$100.00	$70.00
4901
89	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Five complete VF MNH complete sets of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2020 Unitrade.	$325.00	$70.00
3613
90	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$65.00
4302
91	Canada #BK5d (English), BK5f (English). Two different GeoV Admiral booklets, each booklet containing two panes of six of the 2c carmine (#106a).

1393
104	Canada - 1974 Annual Collection. Superb condition example of the first 8½"x 11" large format (and key issue) Canada Post Annual Collection (Unitrade #17). The VF mint NH stamps are all still stored in the original glassines. The lot includes the original Canada Post envelope. Due to the delicate nature of the binding and the tendency of collectors to punch holes through the covers, very few of these books have survived intact. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$95.00
5880
105	Canada - Annual Collections 1983/1995 and Thematic Collections #11/89. Lightly duplicated mix of six Canada Post Yearbooks and thirteen Unitrade listed Thematic collections, offered as received.

This "The Story of Canada" collection consists of 84 different gold foil cacheted FDCs, all mounted on a full colour illustrated page with a story on the event being commemorated, along with a VF mint NH Canadian (or Newfoundland) stamp also associated with the event. Not quite a complete run of all the covers, as many of the subscribers ended the acquisition of these pricey items ($9.95 each for an original cost for this lot of $835.80) as the cost became excessive. Still a great collection for the fan of Canadian history and scarce cachet types for the FDC cachet collector. Estimate	$250.00	$90.00

In excellent condition and ideal for expansion into this still-growing area of Canadian philately.

5526
70	Canada #1407ai (x 2). Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from the "CANADA 92" international stamp exhibition. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$100.00
5577
71	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH. The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the Post Office quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2020 Unitrade.	$161.00	$95.00
1003
72	Canada #1969, 1970 TRIPLE ARTIST SIGNED. VF mint NH complete pane of 25 of the 2003 issue 48c "Year of the Ram" plus the $1.25 souvenir sheet, both sheets triple signed by the illustrator/calligrapher (Rosina Li), sculptor/illustrator (Christopher Reid) and the illustrator (Jason Li). Very few of these panes/sheets were signed (it was a small side event at the stamp unveiling in Vancouver). Estimate	$150.00	$70.00
5614
73	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
5726
74	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Estimate	$250.00	$325.00
6009
75	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK 686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$100.00
5989
76	Canada #BK3d (ENGLISH), BK5f (ENGLISH). Duo of clean KGV Admiral issue booklets, consisting of the 1c green (four panes of 6) with sans-serif capitals rate sheet (panes stuck to the glassine interleaves) and 2c carmine (two panes of 6) with small Type II text and overprinted cover.

The empty pages and binders retail for over $100.00 alone. Canada Post currently charges a $1.00 surcharge per FDC which means the probable "new issue" cost of this lot of FDCs is over $600.00. Conservatively estaimted for the face value of the stamps on cover. Total face value	$396.91	$110.00
5604

86	Canada #1395a. VF MNH complete roll of 100 of the 43c olive green Flag 1992 coil issue on DF paper, with massive strip of 25 imperf stamps about one third of the way from the start. Unitrade catalogue notes that only 3 strips of 25 have been reported - this roll expands that number to 4 as it comes from a long term holding. The imperf stamps show red "printer's rejection marks" however they were still rolled and sold. As this is an unopened roll it has also been unchecked for spacing varieties. 2020 Unitrade.	$2,575.00	$325.00
3827
87	Canada #1601b (BK190 IMPERFORATE). VF mint condition, pristine and intact 1996 issue "Special Occasions" Greetings Booklet #3, containing a self-adhesive pane of ten 45c stamps, WITH THE DIE-CUTTING COMPLETELY OMITTED. Only four panes have recorded and one of these panes has been separated into 3 sections. Needless to say, as one of the 3 remaining panes this is a modern booklet error of the utmost magnitude. The booklet comes with a 2010 APES photo certificate which states, in part "genuine in all respects". Never seen one before! 2020 Unitrade.	$5,000.00	$1,525.00

4901
89	Canada #1700 (BK236). DRAMATIC MIS-CUT. VF and intact booklet pane of the 2000 issue 47c "Flag over Inukshuk" die-cut self-adhesive, with the horizontal die-cut severely misplaced towards the top of the pane, creating large "one and two thirds" stamps on the bottom row and "one third" stamps at top. A black and white copy of the booklet with red die-cut indicators helps to explain the error. Estimate	$250.00	$210.00
5614
90	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$65.00
5936
91	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes.

Look for sets to increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$120.00	$65.00
5526
92	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$130.00
4005
93	Canada #3059 (or 3064). VARIETY. Unreported missing colour variety! #3059 (or #3064) 'MacMillan Provincial Park' with missing red 'P in maple leaf' on a small piece (uncanceled), lower left stamp corner slightly clipped.

A perfect lot for the FDC dealer to break down and resell at a decent markup. The lot also includes three "nearly new" condition First Day Cover albums (retail over $100.00 new). The lot is conservatively valued for the face value of the stamps on cover only. Total Face Value of the Stamps on Cover	$560.54	$110.00

5567
60	Canada #96-103. Complete mint eight stamp commemorative pictorial set for the Quebec Tercentenary of 1908. A nice sound and F/VF set, generally OG H/HR (a couple with gum disturbance and the 20c is no gum). 2021 Scott US$978.00=	$1,271.40	$70.00
5953
61	Canada #104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 112a, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119 (x 3 shades). All MNH, lightly duplicated selection of GeoV Admiral issues, from 1c to 20c values. Includes key values, shades and some very nice VF pieces in the mix. 2021 Scott US$3,032.50=	$3,942.25	$400.00
4350

3725
64	Canada #113iv. Fresh and very well centered VF mint OG HR example of the rare Unitrade listed greenish yellow shade (1915-1916 printing) of the 7c GeoV Admiral, formerly known and often still identified as a pale version of the sage green shade. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$140.00

5538
67	Canada #158, 159. Fresh and Fine mint NH examples of the 50c Bluenose and $1.00 Parliament high values from the 1928-1929 GeoV "Scroll" series. 2021 Scott US$1,000.00=	$1,300.00	$130.00
5976

2050
69	Canada #195-201. Fresh and F/VF MNH complete 1932 issue KGV Medallion set of seven. A very pretty set. 2021 Scott US$263.50=	$342.55	$55.00
5538
70	Canada #203, 203i Specialist Lot. Scarce lot of 5 covers and one used block of the 1934 issue 20c Harvester with "WORLD'S GRAIN EXHIBITION & CONFERENCE REGINA 1933" overprint. Four of the covers are July 24th 1933 First Day Covers, including postmaster signed and various cachets. The fifth cover is a 45c rate commercial airmail cover, Nelson BC to Colombia. The VF used sheet margin block of 6 includes a "Broken X" overprint. All valued by Scott Classic catalogue. 2020 Scott US$378.00=	$491.20	$95.00
5614
71	Canada #211-216. FIRST DAY COVERS. Complete 1935 GeoV "Silver Jubilee" set of 6 on matching cacheted FDCs. Toronto May 4th CDS First Day Cancels. All the cachets are matching woodcut type "King George V profile" motifs. Very rare cachets, especially when offered as a complete "matched set" of all 6 different covers. The Unitrade catalogue value of $104.00 is irrelevant in valuing a set of covers like this. Estimate	$200.00	$120.00
5614
72	Canada #217-227. Fresh and F/VF MNH complete 1935 issue GeoV "Champlain" set of eleven. A decent quality group, the 50c and $1.00 high values being particularly nice. 202 Scott US$180.30=	$234.39	$36.00
5538
73	Canada #217-227, C5, E6. FIRST DAY COVERS. Complete 1935 GeoV "Champlain" set of 11 on matching cacheted FDCs, plus the Airmail and Special Delivery stamps that accompany the set. Proper Ottawa June 1st cancels. All the cachets are matching multi-colour hand-coloured woodcut type "Beaver and Maple Leaf" motifs. Very rare cachets, especially when offered as a complete "matched set" of 13 different covers. The Unitrade catalogue value of $476.00 is irrelevant in valuing a set of covers like this. Estimate	$600.00	$280.00
4652
74	Canada #224iv. F/VF used lower left corner positional block of 6 of the 13c violet KGV 1935 issue with the "Vertical scratch in N" variety at position 46, with partial plate #1 inscription below position 47. Vertical perf separation between top and bottom rows, upper right stamp with light crease, light Victoria CDS cancels not obscuring the variety. A scarce engraved plate flaw in any condition, even scarcer in a used multiple. 2020 Unitrade.	$312.50	$230.00
5614
75	Canada #241-245, 241a. VF mint NH 1938 issue GeoVI "Chateau Ramezay" set of five plus the extra carmine rose shade of the 10c Memorial Chamber. Unitrade is $336.00 for the VF MNH set plus the extra shade. 2020 Scott US$227.00=	$295.10	$60.00

5917
77	Canada #459bpii. Sound and VF used example of the rare 6c orange Centennial, perf 12.5 x 12, Winnipeg Tagged on Hibrite paper. Missing from most Centennial collections. At fewer than 100 used examples known, this stamp is much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. 2020 Unitrade.	$500.00	$210.00
4178
78	Canada #460. 6c Black Centennial Study Collection. Very comprehensive, properly identified and well organized selection/collection/study of the 6c black Centennial including numerous Unitrade listed varieties. Includes numerous mint matched sets of plate blocks/corner blocks, booklet panes, hundreds of used stamps with key values like 460ii (Hibrite dex), 460giii (perf 10 Hibrite), 460civ (doubling of 6) and 460fi (printed on gum side). The key items alone (accounting for duplication) come to $2,835.00 by Unitrade catalogue. A perfect lot for the Centennial student/dealer. See the owner's printed list for more details regarding quantities and condition. Estimate	$650.00	$550.00
4005
79	Canada #460ii. Rare complete VF MNH pane of 100 of the 1970 issue 6c black QEII Centennial, Die I with white DEX gum, printed on HIBRITE paper. This variety only exists without inscriptions, full selvedge at left interestingly enough has a closely spaced row of perfs (and a pair of staple holes). Here's a seldom offered chance to acquire a pristine example of an intact pane of a key Centennial variety! 2020 Unitrade.	$2,040.00	$220.00
5985
80	Canada #465B, 600i. VF mint NH matched sets of two popular Dollar values, consisting of the $1.00 Centennial (plate #1 Dex) and the $1.00 Vancouver Harbour perf 11 x 11 on horizontally ribbed paper (blank corners). 2020 Unitrade.	$360.00	$44.00
3434
81	Canada #582-585. VF mint NH investment group of 15 full mint NH philatelic (untrimmed, with full plate inscriptions and wide selvedge margins) panes of 16 of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant Earth Sciences commemorative. Note different plate positions. 2020 Unitrade.	$525.00	$55.00
269
82	Canada #768i. GHOST PRINT VARIETY. Pristine VF MNH 1978 issue philatelic pane of 50 with the first 7 columns showing distinct doubling of the name "Marguerite D'Youville" in banner at top. The doubling gets more pronounced from right to left, with the doubling in the first 2 columns obvious to the naked eye and columns 8-10 with the doubling too closely spaced to be called the variety. 2020 Unitrade.	$1,435.10	$190.00
5038
83	Canada #926B. DRAMATIC MIS-PERF Pair. Mint NH dramatically mis-perforated sheet margin pair of the 1987 issue 36c "Parliament Buildings" definitive, showing parts of four different stamps on the lower stamp and parts of two stamps plus a big chunk of the margin in the top stamp. The tagging is also skewed, being in the white margins (as it should be). An eye-catching modern error. Estimate	$200.00	$110.00
5985
84	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00
347
85	Canada #2110i. VF mint NH example of the rare Unitrade catalogue recognized perforation variety of the original 2005 issue "Homer Watson" souvenir sheet. The perforations that usually extend to the sheet edge above and below the stamps on the common sheet stop at the upper and lower stamp edge in this rare variety. Verified and newly listed in the 2020 Unitrade catalogue (fifteen years after the original issue date!) with extremely few examples coming to market in this time. An exceptional chance to grab what could easily become a frighteningly rare perforation variety. Estimate	$250.00	$210.00
3773
86	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$70.00
5985
87	Canada #C1-C9, CE1-CE4, E1-E11. All mint H/NH (#E1 no gum) complete sets of Airmails (9 stamps), Airmail Special Deliveries (4 stamps) and Special Delivery Airmails (11 stamps). All in black mounts on "Unity" album pages. A useful starter group. 2021 Scott US$668.35=	$868.85	$42.00

Consisting of the scarce 1927 "Confederation" issue 20c orange and then a complete run of all the 1935 to 1946 period issues. Unitrade is $327.50 for the good-looking VFNH group. 2017 Scott US$171.75=	$223.27	$50.00
5912
90	Canada #F1i. VF mint full OG VLH example of the Unitrade listed orange red shade of the 2c Registration stamp. An elusive shade. Fresh and perfectly centered. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$150.00
4740
91	Canada #J1-J5, J1a, J2a, J4a. Fresh, well centered and LH 1906 to 1928 "First" issue Postage Dues, including the thin paper types of the 1c, 2c and 5c values. 2021 Scott US$357.50=	$464.75	$60.00
870

4303
93	Canada #MR2Bi. Just Fine mint OG LH example of the "Inland Revenue/War Tax" overprint in black on the 5c blue KGV Admiral. A key WWI War Tax postal-fiscal provisional. 2017 Unitrade.	$120.00	$46.00

Fresh and F/VF mint NH complete run of all the OHMS overprinted 1949 to 1950 GeoVI period Officials including the rare 50c Lumbering (only 50,000 printed) as well as the Official Airmail and Official Special Delivery stamps. A very decent quality group. 2021 Scott US$375.50=	$488.15	$190.00
5912
95	Canada #O16-O49, O38a. Complete fresh and F/VF mint H/NH run of all 33 of the 1950-1963 issue "G" overprinted Officials (no Official Airmail or Special Delivery stamps) plus the "Flying G" variety of the 50c Textiles. A superior quality group. 2021 Scott US$253.20=	$329.16	$65.00
5912
96	Canada #O25, O27. VF mint NH examples of the 1951 issue 10c Fur Resources and $1.00 Fisheries, both with "G" Official overprints. 2020 Unitrade is $123.00 for the VF mint NH duo. 2021 Scott US$81.40=	$105.82	$32.00

4389
99	Canada #OX1. VF centered Jumbo margin mint no gum example of the 1879 issue Dead Letter Office stamp. Multiple paper hinge remnants and what appears to be a very small and shallow thin at top (probably from Hinge removal). A rare and undervalued "Back of the Book" item. 2020 Unitrade.	$750.00	$65.00
3543

This would conservatively make the original Canadian post office "new issue" cost of this lot (considering that some of the older covers have lower premiums) to total over $600.00! A perfect lot for the FDC dealer to break down and resell at a decent markup. The lot also includes three "nearly new" condition First Day Cover albums (retail over $100.00 new).

Not quite a complete run of all the covers, as many of the subscribers ended the acquisition of these pricey items ($9.95 each for an original cost for this lot of $835.80) as the cost became excessive.

5038
79	Canada #204. Rare intact and F/VF+ mint NH full sheet of 100 of the 1933 issue 5c dark blue "Royal William" steamship commemorative. Due to the massive size of this sheet, very few sheets remain intact (postmasters often split these sheets in two upon receipt). Folded down the middle and with a few minor marginal perf separations noted for the record. The sheet has Plate #2 plate blocks at the upper right and upper left corners, with the lower corners blank. All the stamps have perfect gum and many are VF centered. Conservatively valued as 100 x MNH singles by Scott catalogue. Considerable potential upside if re-valued by Unitrade catalogue. 2021 Scott US$2,000.00=	$2,600.00	$375.00

Rarely offered mint NH collection of Centennial issues (missing only the 6c orange and 8c slate to be fully represented) with Province of Saskatchewan provincial government official perfins, consisting of 142 stamps in singles and blocks of up to 6. This lot is offered as received as part of a large modern mint consignment and a quick check revealed several items NOT YET LISTED in the BNAPS Perfin Handbook. The previous owner's identifications are not always accurate. A great opportunity to spend some time to identify them all and contribute to the online resource. Estimate	$250.00	$280.00
3606
85	Canada #460f. DRAMATIC MISPERF. Mint NH example of the 6c black Centennial issue (perf 12 x 12), dramatically mis-perfed. An eye-catching Elizabethan showpiece. Estimate	$200.00	$50.00

Complete se-tenant full inscription sheets of 100 and 50 of the 1970 issue Christmas stamps, both regular and with the much scarcer Winnipeg Phosphor Tagging, featuring the much sought after identical centre blocks of four and several other semi-constant varieties. All F/VF and mint NH, some small perf separations at edges to be expected. The centre blocks (making up much of the catalogue value) are all perfect. 2020 Unitrade.	$1,065.00	$130.00
3619
87	Canada #543, 544. Study/Stock/Accumulation. Comprehensive organized and identified duplicated mint and used study/collection/stock of the 7c slate green and 8c slate QEII Centennial issues. In the lot we noted matched sets of corner/plate blocks, booklet panes, tagging, paper and gum varieties, all properly grouped by an experienced Centennial collector. The face value of the mint is $88.84 and none of the substantial quantity of used material has been catalogued. A great basis for expansion. Mint Stamps only 2020 Unitrade.	$1,439.00	$190.00
4249
88	Canada #582p-585p. VF mint NH investment group of 12 full mint NH Ottawa Tagged panes of 16 of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant Earth Sciences commemorative. A very high quality selection. Tagged panes are MUCH harder to find than the regular panes. 2020 Unitrade.	$480.00	$55.00
2299
89	Canada #765i. Pristine VF MNH philatelic pane of 50, still sealed in Canada Post package, of the 1978 Natural Resources issue with kiss print doubling of the silver inscriptions on the "Cobalt Silver Mine" 14c stamp. Similar to other contemporary kiss prints the second impression is clearly visible behind the primary printing under magnification. Plate blocks remain unpriced in the Unitrade catalogue though would command a premium over the listed se-tenant pairs. 2020 Unitrade.	$10,000.00	$2,925.00
5342
90	Canada #1048a T-3 ERROR. VF MNH right margin block of 4 of the 32c Casgrain and Murphy issue with G2aC one bar tag ERROR with tag bars running vertically through '2'. This error appears to have the tagging shifted to the right by 6 mm but is in fact shifted to the right by 42mm as the left column stamps in the discovery sheet were completely untagged. Adminware database retail value	$420.00	$40.00
3634
91	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$70.00
5526
92	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
4034
93	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2020 Unitrade.	$500.00	$44.00

The condition is a bit mixed (expect faults) and there is heavy duplication of some material. Valuation is based upon the total of the prices on each card (multiplied by the number of stamps in each card). Face values tend to go up to the 1sh with the Victorias, 5sh with Edwards, 2sh6p with the GeoV and 10sh with the GeoVI material. Could be good hunting grounds for the cancel or variety collector. Owner's total retail/catalogue value	$46,026.00	$900.00

The 25c high value of the Christmas 1977 issue in a VF MNH matched set of plate blocks with clear kiss print doubling of the black printing, both in 'CHRISTMAS NOEL JESOUS AHATONHIA' on the stamps as well as in the marginal inscriptions.

1751
70	Canada #768i. GHOST PRINT VARIETY. Pristine VF MNH 1978 issue philatelic pane of 50 with the first 7 columns showing distinct doubling of the name "Marguerite D'Youville" in banner at top.

VF MNH left-hand sheet margin block of eight on the scarcer LF paper of the 1979 issue 17c green Parliament definitive with perfs and tagging shifted a massive 7½ mm to the left.

Mint NH dramatically mis-perforated sheet margin pair of the 1987 issue 36c "Parliament Buildings" definitive, showing parts of four different stamps on the lower stamp and parts of two stamps plus a big chunk of the margin in the top stamp.

74	Canada #1395a. VF MNH complete roll of 100 of the 43c olive green Flag 1992 coil issue on DF paper, with massive strip of 25 imperf stamps about one third of the way from the start. Unitrade catalogue notes that only 3 strips of 25 have been reported - this roll expands that number to 4 as it comes from a long term holding. The imperf stamps show red "printer's rejection marks" however they were still rolled and sold. As this is an unopened roll it has also been unchecked for spacing varieties. 2020 Unitrade.	$2,575.00	$400.00
5376
75	Canada #1407ai, 1991C-1991D, 2844. VF mint NH trio of scarce to very rare souvenir sheets, consisting of: 1) A VF mint NH example of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, this souvenir sheet bears the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that this sheet is on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers); 2) The 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship sheet. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle; 3) A rare VF mint NH example of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo. The "Hoodoo" souvenir sheet is particularly hard to find and often sells for over full catalogue. This group would make a perfect gift for the advanced Canada collector as these sheets are usually missing for most collections we see. 2020 Unitrade.	$375.00	$260.00

Lot also includes a single used hologram stamp and MNH se-tenant pairs with hologram at left and right. Comes with the owner's original purchase lotting sheets from years ago. 2020 Unitrade.	$299.00	$65.00

Each sheet comes with the Canada Post Corporation Certificate of Authenticity stating limited editions to 1,000 and 1,500, respectively; additionally the key Birds I sheet has the 1996 Philatelic Service Order Statement receipt showing the original (substantial premium at the time) cost of $69.00! Although there have been subsequent press sheets issued in lower quantities, in particular the first signed uncut sheet is still by far the key item in this popular area of "display philately". 2020 Unitrade.	$700.00	$160.00
5567
78	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

165	USA #9X3b. FORGERY. Very well executed FORGERY of the extremely rare 1847 Postmaster Provisional series New York 5c Washington, black on grey wove paper.

4841
61	Canada #1171c. VF MNH example of the rare 44c Walrus on Slater paper, perf 13.8 x 13.1. This is the second rarest of the 1988-1990 Mammal definitive varieties. 2020 Unitrade.	$600.00	$220.00

Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$80.00
5622
64	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH example of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed 50c to 52c rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A rare modern variety. 2019 Unitrade.	$200.00	$48.00
3773
65	Canada #1779a (x 21), 2156 (x 25). VF mint NH investment group of two different undervalued "joint issue" souvenir sheets, consisting of the 1999 Australia/Canada "Marco Polo" sheet (x 21 sheets) containing an 85c Australian stamp and a 46c Canadian stamp, plus the 2006 USA/Canada "Champlain Surveys the East Coast" sheet (x 25 sheets) containing two 39c US stamps and two 51c Canadian stamps. The #2156 sheet has a bar code at lower left, unlike the US produced sheet which has no bar code. Of particular note, and unknown to many collectors is the fact that the Canadian stamps in each of these souvenir sheets have different perforations than the regular issue stamp and are listed in Unitrade catalogue as such (#1779b and #1256a). The combined total face value of the Canadian, US and Australian postage in the sheets is $78.46 with the appropriate conversion rates (US @1.40 and Australian at @.90). 2020 Unitrade.	$323.50	$150.00
4005
66	Canada #2001b. Post Office fresh and VF mint NH wholesale/investment lot of 50 examples of the 2003 issue 96c "National Symbols" souvenir sheet of 2. This sheet was a joint-issue with Thailand, issued for the "Bangkok 2003" stamp show. 2020 Unitrade.	$500.00	$65.00
5526
67	Canada #2357iii. Extremely scarce Unitrade listed mint uncut press panel of 100 of the 2010 issue self-adhesive Striped Coralroot "P" (permanent) die cut coil. These uncut panes were issued in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very elusive modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the sheet is $92.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2020 Unitrade is not consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. The sheet has a light horizontal fold between the middle rows noted for the record. 2020 Unitrade.	$180.00	$70.00
5822
68	Canada #2642ii. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. 2020 Unitrade.	$180.00	$100.00
5233
69	Canada #2793i. VF mint NH example of the 2014 issue $2.50 Red Kelley from the NHL "Original Six" series, AUTOGRAPHED by Red Kelley. The stamp/card has the proper Canada Post hologram.

1393
70	Canada #2844, 2847a (BK623).

The souvenir sheet is particularly hard to find and often sells for over full catalogue. 2020 Unitrade.	$225.00	$200.00
3820
71	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$70.00
5233

114	Canada Postcards - A largely Western Canadian showing of 37 "Exaggeration" style postcards. "Exaggeration" postcards were used to facetiously advertise the products, advantages, or unique aspects of a place.

Loaded with VF CDS stamps, this lot offers the collector high quality used material. Considerable upside if revalued by Unitrade. The 50c Bluenose and $1.00 Parliament are particularly nice. 2020 Scott US$438.10=	$569.53	$210.00
870

5947
56	Canada #159. Fresh and Very Fine, perfectly centered mint NH example of the 1929 issue $1.00 olive green Parliament high value from the GeoV Scroll set. The $1.00 Parliament is considered by many to be the key GeoV era high value. Unitrade is $900.00 for VF mint NH. 2020 Scott US$575.00=	$747.50	$525.00
5376

3543

4034
69	Canada #1407ai. VF mint NH example of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, this souvenir sheet bears the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that this sheet is on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). The signature sheet comes with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. A used regular souvenir sheet (#1407a) accompanies. 2020 Unitrade.	$125.00	$60.00
5178
70	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

5596
71	Canada #1696a, 1699a. Scarce VF mint NH panes of 18 of the 1998 issue 45c (x 4) and 46c (x 4) stylized Maple Leaf ATM definitives. These stamps were issued through ATM machines (hence the banknote size of the panes) and the cost was deducted from the user's bank account. A short-lived experiment and undervalued in Unitrade. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$80.00
5038
72	Canada #1768ii (x 3). Three mint NH 1999 issue Year of the Rabbit uncut sheets, all still in the original mailing tubes. The total original issue price of the three sheets is $74.85. High face value in the stamps that comprise the sheets. 2020 Unitrade.	$225.00	$55.00
4655

VF MNH complete run of all the 1999-2000 Millennium miniature sheets including the basic set of 17 panes plus the additional six "Dove" thematic panes of 4 and 1 as well as the postal stationery post card.

5604
74	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH. The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the Post Office quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2020 Unitrade.	$161.00	$110.00
5178
75	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$75.00
5577
76	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Five complete VF MNH complete sets (still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2020 Unitrade.	$325.00	$80.00
5526
77	Canada #2844, 2847a (BK623). Rare VF mint NH examples of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" stamps, consisting of the $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo" and the complete self-adhesive booklet pane of 6 containing two $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoos". The souvenir sheet is particularly hard to find and often sells for over full catalogue. 2020 Unitrade.	$225.00	$200.00
3049
78	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$70.00
5604

5456
82	Canada #O9. Superb and mathematically centered mint NH example of the 1949 issue OHMS official overprint on the 50c "Lumbering". This is the key overprinted Official, with only 50,000 printed. Unitrade is $330.00 for VF mint NH. 2020 Scott Classic US$200.00=	$260.00	$160.00

The total face value of the mint stamps contained in these books (including the permanent "P" stamps valued at 92 cents each) is $214.15. 2016 Unitrade.	$655.00	$180.00
5898
85	Canada - Bundleware. An untouched accumulation of about 25,000 bundled up many moons ago, as there are bundles tied up from Admiral period stamps to early 1950s, none later. Great potential for specialty material! Estimate	$150.00	$240.00
5952
86	Canada - Modern Premium Postage and More. High quality modern accumulation of mint NH postage, mostly 1970s to 1980s period material with most of the values in the $1.00 to $5.00 range.

Worth full catalogue and more! 2020 Unitrade.	$118.50	$90.00
5614
95	Canada Covers #2844. First Day Cover. Extremely rare cacheted and numbered privately produced First Day Cover of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo". The souvenir sheet on FDC is the key Hoodoo item. This verified Towne Centre Kelowna Post Office production is cover #5 from a total run of 18 covers produced. Peter Lepold produced a set of 18 FDCs with the Hoodoos souvenir sheet error and submitted them through the Towne Center Post Office in Kelowna which is a verified Canada Post outlet so the Unitrade warning about manipulated dates does not apply. No Canada Post outlet would engage in spurious backdating. Lepold's products have been the topics of several stories in CSN, most notably in connection with the Hoodoos stamp error (Scott #2844) of July 3, 2015. Gary Dickinson, First Day Cover columnist for Canadian Stamp News (issue of 10 Dec 2019, page 10) reported that Lepold was fortunate to obtain copies of the erroneous souvenir sheet before they were recalled and produced some FDCs for both single stamps and the souvenir sheet. That number was supplied by Peter himself so it is well verifiable. Note that the thin black line on the scan is from the mount and not on the cover. 2020 Unitrade.	$500.00	$350.00
5614
96	Canada Covers - The Story of Canada. The complete four volume collection of 84 different deluxe gold cacheted First Day covers making up "The Story of Canada" Excelsior Collector's Guild set.

An absolutely spectacular, decades in the assembly, VF used 50c Bluenose SOCK ON THE NOSE CDS month by month calendar collection of 17 stamps, running from January 1929 through October 1930. Only missing five months to be complete for the period. Even as individual stamps, many would qualify as Select and Superb quality. Unitrade is $100.00 per stamp as VF used and you would be hard pressed to find a dealer who would sell this quality at a discount to catalogue. The lot is valued (conservatively) by Unitrade as 17 x VF used stamps. 2020 Unitrade.	$1,700.00	$1,125.00
4197
39	Canada #158. Superbly centered mint Never Hinged example of the famous and iconic 50c Bluenose high value from the 1928 KGV Scroll issue. No Canadian collection is complete without this beautifully engraved item! Unitrade is $700.00 for VF mint NH. 2019 Scott US$425.00=	$552.50	$375.00

1786

This particular set was sold in auction for $2,386.25 ($2,075.00 plus 15% commission) back in 2007. 2020 Unitrade.	$3,600.00	$950.00
269
47	Canada #231-236, 238-240, 241-245, 241a, 245i, C6, E7-E9. Select and choice quality VF mint NH and parallel "Sock on the Nose" VF CDS used collection of 1937 to 1939 period GeoVI issues, all complete sets, including regular, airmail and special delivery stamps. All the coils are in pairs, the 10c Memorial Chamber is in both shades and the $1.00 Chateau Ramezay is printed in both the regular and analine ink types. Any of the stamps in this lot would be at home in any top-notch collection and as a whole, this would be a very difficult group to duplicate. 2020 Unitrade.	$889.13	$350.00
1786
48	Canada #249-262. Fresh and VF mint NH and VF used complete 1942-1943 GeoVI War Issue sets of fourteen. Unitrade is $256.50 for a VF mint NH set and $22.95 for a VF used set. A select quality group. 2020 Scott US$189.75=	$246.67	$70.00

4965
50	Canada #422ii/1446i. VARIETIES. Consignor identified selection of mostly Unitrade listed varieties, including singles, pairs, blocks and plate blocks. Noted paper types, double prints, constant and inconstant plate varieties and more, all VF MNH. Many are heavily duplicated. While a few are scarce, Unitrade often gives some of these types of variety particularly generous valuations. A great lot for the modern variety dealer/collector. Owner's 2020 Unitrade.	$4,444.00	$525.00
4005
51	Canada #434q. VF mint NH investment lot of 35 examples of the 1964 issue 3c red WINNIPEG TAGGED "Star of Bethlehem" Christmas stamp miniature pane of 25. All in pristine condition. 2019 Unitrade.	$525.00	$55.00
5876
52	Canada #459. Monster accumulation of perhaps 50,000 used six cent orange Centennials on close-cut single paper. There are some expensive varieties found on this issue so here is a long summer's fun doing the hunting! Postmarks indicate this lot could have had a Manitoba origin. In a bulging banker's box, weighs about 20 lbs. Estimate	$100.00	$220.00
3619
53	Canada #523a, 528a. Clean and VF mint NH selection of 40 se-tenant strips of five of the regular (untagged) types of the 1970 Christmas Childrens' Drawings issues, 5c and 6c values. 2020 Unitrade.	$340.00	$32.00

5841
55	Canada #592. One Bar Tag Error. VF mint NH full field stock sheet of 100 of the the 7c brown Louis St. Laurent "Caricature" definitive, all one bar tagged. Owner identified by Ken Rose Adminware online catalogue as #592 G2aR @ $40.00 each. These will make a nice page in modern error collection. Owner's Rose catalogue.	$4,000.00	$750.00
5614
56	Canada #727. VARIETY. VF MNH sheet margin example of the 1979 issue $2.00 Kluane with clearly doubled embossing of the "$2 CANADA". One impression is in the regular silver ink, badly shifted towards the bottom, the other impression (in the proper position) is albino. A very noticeable and as of yet uncatalogued variety. Other high value National Parks issues have Unitrade listed double embossing varieties (for example #937iii @ $350.00) or double printing varieties (#727b @ $1,000.00). Comes with a Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which confirms the variety and states "genuine in all respects". Estimate	$500.00	$210.00
5477
57	Canada #768i. GHOST PRINT VARIETY. Four VF MNH plate blocks (two UL and two LL) of the 1978 issue Marguerite D'Youville. The name "Marguerite D'Youville" in banner at top shows distinct doubling. 2020 Unitrade.	$700.00	$110.00
4841
58	Canada #1250ii. Rare VF MNH lower left position inscription block of four of the 1989 issue 38c Regiments commemorative. The vast majority of these stamps were recalled due to very poor printing quality. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$75.00
5427
59	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$50.00
5233
60	Canada #1396. TAGGING ERROR. Mint NH strip of four of the 45c blue green "Flag" coil, all the stamps 3-Bar Tagged (G4aT). Note that the strip is also printed on Hibrite paper. A scarce modern tagging error. Del Peters cat.	$200.00	$80.00
4841
61	Canada #1407ai (x 2). Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$85.00
5820
62	Canada #1630ai. VF MNH investment lot of 50 of the 1997 Year of the Ox souvenir sheet of two x 45c Lunar New Year stamps with the additional limited edition "Hong Kong 97" logo printed in lower right corner of the sheet. This is the scarcest (and first) Lunar New Year souvenir sheet. Excellent investment opportunity. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$55.00
5233
63	Canada #1972. VF mint NH investment lot of five self-adhesive 2003 issue 48c NHL All Stars hockey panes of six. This pane is very hard to find as it was not included in either the quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$120.00
5389
64	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$90.00
5820
65	Canada #2080b (BK302Ab). Two VF condition, intact and unpunched examples of the 50c Flag over Five scenes (#2076-2080) booklet of ten PRINTED ON GUM SIDE. The result is NO GUM on the back of the stamps if you peel them off, the gum being on the backing paper layer instead. 29 roulette slits format. Recently renumbered and undervalued in Unitrade. Nice to get two booklets for display purposes. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$110.00
5614
66	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Four complete VF MNH complete sets (still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2020 Unitrade.	$325.00	$65.00
3613
67	Canada #2357iii. Extremely scarce Unitrade listed mint uncut press panel of 100 of the 2010 issue self-adhesive Striped Coralroot "P" (permanent) die cut coil. These uncut panes were issued in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very elusive modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the sheet is $92.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2020 Unitrade is not consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. The sheet has a light horizontal fold between the middle rows noted for the record. 2020 Unitrade.	$180.00	$110.00
5614
68	Canada #2362a. Unlisted VARIETY. The $1.00 "Giant Helleborine" booklet pane of 6 with INVERTED DIE CUTTING. This creates an imperforate between block of four at bottom with PUNCH HOLE (punched for hanging the booklet for display) & severe mis-cutting of the two top stamps (serpentine Die Cuts run through the top of flowers). Also note the 3-BAR TAGGING on top pair (G4dH). As of yet unlisted in Unitrade. Estimate	$500.00	$325.00
5614
69	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$85.00
5820
70	Canada #BK81f (x 5). VF group of the five different cover designs of the 1979 issue 17c green green and black QEII definitive booklets, all with vertical black "wedges" in the lower half of the tab of each booklet pane. A great companion to the next lot (black wedges in the upper half of the pane tab). 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00
5614
71	Canada #BK81f (x 5). VF group of the five different cover designs of the 1979 issue 17c green green and black QEII definitive booklets, all with vertical black "wedges" in the upper half of the tab of each booklet pane. A great companion to the previous lot (black wedges in the lower half of the pane). 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00
5614
72	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2020 Unitrade.	$500.00	$55.00
5526
73	Canada #BK 395. Full Set of 24. Rare complete set of all 24 different 2009 issue booklets of 10 "Permanent" Olympic stamps, issued for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, all in pristine MNH condition. Each booklet has a different numbered reverse (1 to 24) featuring a different "Did you know?" Olympic fact and photograph. An insanely difficult group to assemble with a total present day face value of $220.80. The Unitrade catalogue value of a complete set is ridiculously low considering how seldom we see sets of these booklets. 2020 Unitrade for 24 basic individual booklets	$408.00	$400.00
5614
74	Canada #C5ii. Fresh and VF mint NH example of the "Moulting Wing" variety on the 1935 issue 6c red brown Daedalus airmail stamp (plate #1, LR pane, position 14). A scarce and popular constant plate flaw. 2020 Unitrade.	$234.00	$85.00
1592
75	Canada #E1iv. Archivally fresh, VF+ mint NH example of the Unitrade listed deep blue green shade of the 1898 issue 10c Special Delivery. This stamp has been cared for and coddled since the day it was issued. A real Special Delivery gem. 2020 Unitrade.	$1,600.00	$1,275.00
4303
76	Canada #E3c. VF mint LH part perforate vertical pair (imperf horizontally) of the 1927 issue 20c orange Special Delivery from the "60th Anniversary of Confederation" set. Only 250 pairs issued. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$130.00
3634
77	Canada #F3. Mint no gum example of the 1876 issue 8c dull blue Registration stamp. An elusive and welcome addition to any Canadian collection. 2020 Scott US$600.00=	$780.00	$75.00
5841
78	Canada #FWH1-FWH10. Ten different mint Canadian Wildlife Conservation Stamps from the years 1985-1994, each one neatly mounted in an individual small picture frame. The 10 stamps have a total face value of $70.00 and the frames must have had a significant cost. These will make a great looking display on the wall of your stamp room. Valued by Unitrade as stamps only. 2020 Unitrade.	$230.00	$24.00
4389
79	Canada #J1/J14. Very nice quality lightly duplicated selection of 30 mint NH/H 1906 to 1934 period Postage Due issues. All laid out on one Hagner stocksheet (the top four rows are NH, the bottom two rows are Hinged). The NH stamps consist of #J1, J2, J2a, J3, J4a, J6, J7, J11 and J13. The Hinged material consists of #J1, J2, J6, J8, J10 and J14. 2020 Scott US$1,059.00=	$1,376.70	$190.00
5567

4249
81	Canada #MR2C. Fresh and F/VF mint NH example of the 1915 issue 20c olive green GeoV Admiral with diagonal "WAR TAX" overprint in black. A key War Tax postal-fiscal stamp. Conservatively valued as Fine NH only. 2020 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
5233
82	Canada #MR5i. VF mint NH block of four of the bright rose red shade of the 1916 issue perf 12 x 8 KGV 2c+1c War Tax. A very scarce War Tax multiple. 2020 Unitrade.	$1,500.00	$875.00
4303
83	Canada #MR7a. Well centered and F/VF mint no gum strip of 12 of the very scarce 1916 issue 2c + 1c brown GeoV Admiral War Tax coil, Die I. A rare War Tax multiple, even without gum. A great strip for display, proving that it was not printed in 10 x 10 sheet format. 2020 Scott US$2,400.00=	$3,120.00	$325.00
5614
84	Canada #O1-O15A, O16-O32, CO1-CO2, EO1-EO2. Archivally fresh and selected quality VF mint NH selection of 36 different 1949 to 1953 period GeoVI era OHMS and G overprinted Officials. Unitrade is $1,085.55 for the VF mint NH group. 2020 Scott US$673.30=	$875.29	$400.00

5115
86	Canada #O7a. Post Office fresh and VF mint NH lower left plate #1 plate block of the 14c Hydroelectric Plant (from the 1946 Peace Issue) OHMS overprinted Official, with the "missing period" variety at sheet position 47 of the OHMS overprint. 2020 Unitrade.	$300.00	$170.00

4968
75	Canada #1407ai. VF mint NH example of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, this souvenir sheet bears the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that this sheet is on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). The signature sheet comes with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. A used regular souvenir sheet (#1407a) accompanies. 2020 Unitrade.	$125.00	$50.00
5841

The 2003 set of sheets is very hard to find as #1972 was not included in either the quarterly pack or annual collection. Modern undervalued items to be sure! 2019 Unitrade.	$161.00	$42.00
5233
78	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2019 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
5428
79	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Five complete VF MNH complete sets (still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2020 Unitrade.	$325.00	$70.00
5428
80	Canada #2642ii. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for close to (and sometimes over) full catalogue. 2020 Unitrade.	$180.00	$95.00
5233
81	Canada #2844, 2844a, 2847a (BK623). VF mint NH group of the recalled 2015 issue "Wrong Hoodoo" stamps, consisting of the $8.60 souvenir sheet containing one $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo", the $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoo" single from the souvenir sheet and the complete self-adhesive booklet pane of 6 containing two $1.20 "Wrong Hoodoos".

3820
82	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo.

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was not included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). The unsevered booklet of thirty is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $43.20.

85	Canada #BK686. Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10.

These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. These regularly sell over full catalogue value.

5734
19	Canada #10. Here's your chance to acquire a genuine mint CERTIFIED example of one of Canada's achingly rare classic stamps, the 1859 issue 6p reddish purple Prince Albert on the very delicate "very thick soft wove paper". Faulty (as usual) but still very presentable, it comes with a Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states "Canada Scott #10, unused, genuine, large central thin, upper left corner missing, creases". Needless to say, missing from most collections in any condition. Fill that annoying empty space in your album today and upgrade later. 2020 Scott US$32,500=	$42,250.00	$2,275.00
5742
20	Canada #14ii. VF used, lightly cancelled example of the 1c rose 1859 First Cents issue on the Unitrade listed "very thick paper".

21	Canada #20. Very Fine centered used example of the 1864 issue 2c Victoria from the "First Cents" series. Very lightly postmarked with a partial CDS cancel. One short perf at lower left noted for the record, otherwise sound in all respects. 2020 Scott US$300.00=	$390.00	$140.00
5115
22	Canada #26iv. F/VF used, very lightly cancelled example of the 5c olive green Large Queen with the Unitrade listed perf 11¾ x 12. This perf variety is often mistaken for the perf 12 x 12 type. Comes with a Vincent Greene photo certificate which states "used, perforated 11¾ x 12, genuine in all respects". Valued as a basic #26 by Scott catalogue. 2020 Scott US$225.00=	$292.50	$210.00
4178
23	Canada #26iv. Fine mint, full OG Light Hinge example of the 5c olive green Large Queen with the Unitrade listed perf 11¾ x 12. This perf variety is often mistaken for the perf 12 x 12 type. Comes with a Vincent Greene photo certificate which states "mint, OG, perforated 11¾ x 12, typical thin dull streaky gum, genuine in all respects". Valued as a basic #26 by Scott catalogue. 2020 Scott US$2,000.00=	$2,600.00	$290.00
5849
24	Canada #30i. VF mint full OG Very LH exceptionally well centered example of the Unitrade listed slate grey shade of the 15c Large Queen. The stamp comes with a 1994 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states in part "Mint, O.G., genuine in all respects". A nice little Large Queen "gem". 2020 Unitrade.	$300.00	$260.00

26	Canada #34-47 plus SHADES. Heavily duplicated lot of used 1/2c, 1c & 2c Small Queens, all housed on cut-down stockbook pages. 1,467 stamps in total. Offered as received, unpicked for cancels or varieties. Noted some earlier printings, especially in the 3c value. Expect some faults in a lot of this type but still a more than worthwhile find for the Small Queen fan. See the small inventory sheet on the page of 1c values for more details. Owner's 2019 Scott US$2,797.00=	$3,636.10	$375.00
4197

589
35	Canada #66, 69. Fresh mint NH examples of the ½c black (VF+) and 3c carmine (F/VF) Queen Victoria "Leaf" issues. The #66 is an absolute "stunner"! 2020 Scott US$262.50=	$341.25	$110.00
5912
36	Canada #79ii. 1899 5c blue on bluish paper QV Numeral in a VF mint imperforate pair. The imperf was issued without gum. 2014 Vincent Graves Greene certificate states "gum added that is not original". 2018 Unitrade.	$900.00	$300.00
5849
37	Canada #84. Mint F/VF centered OG Light Hinge example of the 1900 issue 20c olive green Queen Victoria Numeral high value. Light diagonal bend/crease noted for the record. 2020 Scott US$650.00=	$845.00	$70.00

1786

2740
43	Canada #112a. VF MNH and vibrantly fresh upper sheet margin (plate #2) example of the 5c violet KGV Admiral on thin paper. Unitrade is $150.00 for VF MNH. Hinged in the selvedge only, the stamp is perfect NH. 2020 Scott US$87.50=	$113.75	$60.00
5849
44	Canada #119. Fresh mint NH and almost VF example of the of the 1925 printing of the 20c olive green KGV Admiral (dry printing). 2020 Scott US$275.00=	$357.50	$80.00
5849
45	Canada #142, 224, 225. Inscription Blocks. VF mint plate blocks of 6 of three different 1927 to 1935 issue GeoV issues.

A very clean group. 2020 Unitrade.	$540.00	$325.00
4178
46	Canada #142/553 plus Back of the Book. Mint and used collection of 326 mint Hinged and 378 used stamps, 1898 to 1971 period issues. Noted complete GeoV and GeoVI period complete mint sets plus some better "Back of the Book" single items. Expect the odd fault in a lot of this "as received" type. See the detailed inventory list for more information. 2020 Scott US$1,470.10=	$1,911.13	$120.00
5178
47	Canada #149-157. Album page with neatly mounted 1928-1929 period KGV Scroll issue, H/NH part set in pairs, up to the 20c "Harvesting Wheat" value, each pair with the right stamp NH, F to VF centering. A few nice VF stamps noted in the mix. 2020 Scott US$623.65=	$810.75	$85.00
4350

4197
49	Canada #160, 161. Fresh and VF mint NH pairs of the 1929 issue 1c orange and 2c green KGV "Scroll" issue coils. Unitrade is $480.00 for the VFNH set of coil pairs. 2020 Scott US$300.00=	$390.00	$210.00
870
50	Canada #160-161, 178-183, 205-207, 228-230, 238-240. F/VF mint H/NH selection of 17 different 1928-1937 issue GeoV and GeoVI coil issues, all complete sets. All conservatively valued as Hinged. 2020 Scott US$262.25=	$341.57	$55.00
5574
51	Canada #162, 163iii, 164, 168, 171. Quintet of fresh and F/VF mint NH blocks of four of five different 1930-1931 GeoV "Arch/Leaf" issues, including a plate #2 corner block of #162 and the major re-entry on the 1c green in a block with 3 regular stamps (#163iii). A very nice group with significant Unitrade upside, all VERY conservatively valued by Scott catalogue. 2020 Scott US$380.00=	$494.00	$70.00
5849
52	Canada #162-174, 163b, 165a, 166ii, 166b, 169a, 170i, 190, 191. Carefully selected choice VF+ mint NH all different (by Unitrade) collection of 21 different 1930-1931 period GeoV "Arch/Leaf" series issues, including scarcer Unitrade listed varieties like the pale yellow brown shade of the 2c (#166ii), the milky blue shade of the 5c (170i), plus the 10c dark green George-Etienne Cartier and the 3c on 2c provisional overprinted "Arch/Leaf". If you are a stamp "grader" type, this is the lot for you as there are many stamps with very high grading numbers in this group. To assemble a lot similar to this one would take years of patient acquisition (and probably a lot of money). Worth full catalogue and more. 2020 Unitrade.	$600.00	$325.00
4965
53	Canada #162-177. Fresh, sound and F/VF (almost all VF) mint H complete set of 16 of the 1930 to 1931 GeoV "Arch/Leaf" series. The 50c Grand Pre and $1.00 Cavell are particularly well centered. 2020 Scott US$515.25=	$669.83	$95.00
5707
54	Canada #192-194, 192i, C4. Superb mint NH 1932 "Imperial Economic Conference" set of three, including the overprinted airmail issue, plus the Unitrade listed "Broken E" constant plate flaw on the 3c value (#192i). 2020 Unitrade.	$312.00	$120.00
589
55	Canada #198a. F/VF mint OG (slightly glazed from storage) imperforate pair of the 1932 issue 4c ochre GeoV "Medallion". 2020 Scott US$225.00=	$292.50	$70.00
5849
56	Canada #249/257. Selection of 74 GeoVI War Issue plate blocks, all mounted on Quadrille album pages. Nice range of plate numbers and positions.

4249
57	Canada #249-262, 263-267, 278-281. Fresh and F/VF mint LH (some NH) 1942-1943 GeoVI War Issue set of 14 plus both coil sets (perf 8 and perf 9½). All valued as Hinged. 2020 Scott US$194.50=	$252.85	$85.00
4197
58	Canada #582-585. VF mint NH investment group of 15 full mint NH philatelic (untrimmed, with full plate inscriptions and wide selvedge margins) panes of 16 of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant Earth Sciences commemorative. A very high quality selection. 2019 Unitrade.	$525.00	$70.00
5876
59	Canada #582p-585p. VF mint NH investment group of 10 full mint NH Ottawa Tagged panes of 16 of the 1972 issue 15c se-tenant Earth Sciences commemorative. A very high quality selection. Tagged panes are MUCH harder to find than the regular panes. 2020 Unitrade.	$400.00	$90.00
4249
60	Canada #592. One Bar Tag Error. VF mint NH full field stock sheet of 100 of the the 7c brown Louis St. Laurent "Caricature" definitive, all one bar tagged. Owner identified by Ken Rose Adminware online catalogue as #592 G2aR @ $40.00 each. These will make a nice page in modern error collection. Owner's Rose catalogue	$4,000.00	$325.00
5595
61	Canada #614a. VF mint NH Unitrade listed 15c RCMP Musical Ride left hand sheet margin imperforate pair, fresh and completely without any of the usual creases or wrinkles. Light gum dulling from storage noted for the record. The provenance is apparently the Sir Gawaine Baillie collection. 2020 Unitrade.	$600.00	$100.00
3613
62	Canada #715-G2ac, 790-G2aR, 790-G2aC, 859-G2aR, 1122-G4aT, 1534ii. Selection of five different VF mint NH tagging errors plus a VF mint NH example of the 1994 unissued 52c Christmas stamp. A nice modern error group. Combined Ken Rose and Unitrade catalogue values.	$360.00	$75.00
5038
63	Canada #818a. The 1979 issue 17c "Le Vaisseau d'Or" with blue double printed F/VF MNH. Light gum wrinkle. 2018 Unitrade.	$500.00	$80.00
5038
64	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2019 Unitrade.	$400.00	$42.00
3634
65	Canada #1407ai (x 2). Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2020 Unitrade.	$250.00	$65.00
5648
66	Canada #1736-1737i, 1837ii/2258ii. VF condition duplicated selection of 4 different Lunar New Year uncut press sheets, plus the 1998 RCMP sheet, all in the original tubes. The group consists of the Lunar New Year issues for 2000 (Dragon x 4), 2001 (Snake x 1), 2002 (Horse x 2), 2008 (Rat x 1) plus the RCMP sheet (x 1).

5822
67	Canada #1764b. VF MNH example of the 1998 issue 45c Xmas Angel in the very rare perf 13.1 x 13.6. Fewer than 500 mint examples of #1764b are known. 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$180.00
3049
68	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2018 Unitrade.	$200.00	$85.00
5822
69	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Four complete VF MNH complete sets (two still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2020 Unitrade.	$260.00	$55.00
4302
70	Canada #BK88. "LIGHTNING STORM" QUARTET. Kasimir Bileski discovered and promoted "Storm" quartet of 1985 issue 50c "Parliament" booklets, each pane showing a different position of what Bileski calls lightning running through the centre row of 5c values. The lot includes Bileski's original evocative and imaginative write-up. Bileski's original 1985 retail.	$100.00	$65.00
4249
71	Canada #BK111a. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2019 Unitrade.	$500.00	$55.00
5876
72	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
4249
73	Canada #BK686. Recalled Hanukkah Booklets. Two VF mint intact examples of the extremely scarce recalled 2017 Hanukkah self-adhesive "P" booklets of 10. These booklets were recalled by Canada Post within hours of issuance, with severe consequences threatened for any post office or outlet disobeying the order. These booklets are proving to be the scarcest recalls in recent Canadian philatelic history. The problem was the use of the Star of David as a motif, on both the front cover and on the "colour key" in the lower right corner of the pane. These regularly sell over full catalogue value. Estimate	$150.00	$60.00
5614
74	Canada - Christmas Booklet Error (2019). VF condition example of the rare and well known "printed on the gum side" error on the "Wise Men Journey to Bethlehem" (Maji) Permanent rate Christmas stamp booklet of 12. The entire run of this booklet design was abruptly withdrawn from all post offices right after the day of issue due to a few reports of this "wrong gum side" printing mistake. I suspect that very few escaped the recall. Even the normal booklets are hard to find. Estimate	$350.00	$250.00
5614
75	Canada #C1a. VF mint LH sheet margin imperforate pair of the 5c brown olive 1928 issue airmail. Unitrade is $350.00 for a VF hinged pair. Note Sanabria guarantee handstamp on reverse. 2020 Scott US$260.00=	$338.00	$120.00
5614
76	Canada #C2, E3. Two of the toughest 1920s/1930s era "Back of the Book" issues, consisting of the 1927 Confederation 20c orange Special Delivery and the 1928 Mercury 5c olive brown Airmail, both in choice and spectacular VF+/Superb mint NH condition. Both are worthy of the finest collection. Unitrade is $290.00 for this "dynamic duo". 2020 Scott US$170.00=	$221.00	$80.00
3740
77	Canada #C5ii. Fresh and VF mint, perfectly centered, NH example of the "Moulting Wing" variety on the 1935 issue 6c red brown Daedalus airmail stamp (plate #1, LR pane, position 14).

5614
75	Canada #1407ai (x2). Two VF mint NH examples of the famous "Signature Sheet" from CANADA 92. Only 10,000 issued. Printed for the CANADA 92 program, these souvenir sheets bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, de Maisonneuve". Also of note is the fact that these sheets are on Harrison Paper, a different stock than the unsigned sheet (Coated Papers). Both sheets come with the original "Lighthouse" advertising packaging. 2019 Unitrade.	$250.00	$70.00
5596
76	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2019 Unitrade.	$800.00	$250.00
4901
77	Canada #1818-1834. Scarce complete set of all 17 different 1999-2000 issue 46c Millennium mini-sheets of four on official unaddressed Canada Post First Day Covers. These sheets on FDC are the scarcest way that these sheets are found but the Unitrade catalogue lists FDCs for less than a used sheet off cover. A severely undervalued set of covers. 2020 Unitrade.	$85.00	$55.00
5819
78	Canada #1884ii/2297ii. VF condition selection of 9 different Lunar New Year uncut press sheets, all in the original tubes.

Total original issue price of all nine sheets is $238.55. 2019 Unitrade.	$700.00	$100.00
899
79	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2019 Unitrade.	$250.00	$95.00
5596
80	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c.

A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2017 Unitrade.	$325.00	$95.00
870
81	Canada #2847a (BK623), 3051a (BK686). Two recalled error booklets. The first is the 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Hoodoos) Booklet, the scarce recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps, including two of the misidentified "Hoodoos". Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. The second booklet is the famous November 2017 recalled Hanukkah booklet. This booklet was recalled in a panic by Canada Post (almost within hours of the official issue date) due to the use of the Star of David as a design element, both on the cover and on the pane. The official explanation was that the Menorah is the symbol of Hanukkah, not the Star of David. The new revised booklet has a different cover and pane design. A nice modern OOPs! duo. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
1683
82	Canada #BK623 (x 2). Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$70.00

89	Canada #MR1. Commercial GTR Perfin. Richly fresh, well centered, and mint never hinged left hand sheet margin block of six of the 1915 issue 1c green GeoV WAR TAX with "GTR" (Grand Trunk Railway) private perfin. Of note is the wide spacing of two of the perfin rows, which probably indicates a second run through the perfin press. Valued as MNH regular stamps only. 2020 Scott US$390.00=	$507.00	$85.00
5614
90	Canada #O242/O272, OC6-OC8. Unpicked and "as received" accumulation of 2,029 used 4-hole OHMS Official perfins, 1938 to 1946 period issues. Unchecked for perfin positions or cancels.
