This signed "Duck" booklet is listed in Unitrade and was listed in the 2005 Darnell catalogue but was not listed in the Van Dam catalogue (probably due to a typo) until the latest 2017 edition. The signed booklet is accompanied by a regular unsigned booklet for comparison.

102	Canada #UX427. UNESCO Hoodoo Postcard Stamp Error. Ultra rare recalled 2015 UNESCO Dinosaur Park Canada postal stationery picture post card, depicting the wrong Hoodoos image.

This postcard is the by far the rarest form of the error, as very few postal outlets carry this type of product and only a handful escaped the recall at the Canada Post National Philatelic Centre. The official recall was made less than 48 hours after the stamp release. It is estimated that as few as 25 examples of these post card errors made it into the hands of a few very lucky collectors (who had standing orders for pre-paid postcards) before the Post Office doors slammed shut. Estimate	$1,000.00	$450.00

5614
63	Canada #430/560. Clean and F/VF, almost all (possibly all) mint NH collection of 248 plate blocks or blank corner blocks, 1964 to 1972 period issues, all different for catalogue number, plate number or position.

Owner's accurate 2016 Unitrade.	$658.70	$65.00

Clean and VF mint NH selection of se-tenant strips of five in varying quantities of both the regular and Winnipeg tagged types of the 1970 Christmas Childrens' Drawings issues, 5c and 6c values. The lot consists of 523a (x 30), 528a (x 30), 523ap (x 20) and 528ap (x 20). Nice balanced quantities. 2017 Unitrade.	$475.00	$110.00

4841
67	Canada #929i. VF mint NH matched set of plate blocks of the "brown background" variety of the 1983 issue 48c "Cradle" medium-value definitive. Previously thought to be a magenta missing colour error, the colour variety is due to an anomaly in the ink used by the printer. With an upper right plate #2 block of the true colour for comparison. 2017 Unitrade.	$1,007.50	$400.00
5614
68	Canada #1250ii, 1250a. The whole story of the poor production quality plagued 1989 issue 38c "Canadian Infantry Regiments" commemoratives as laid out in the original documentation, stamps and packaging as received by the consignor. The lot incudes a rare lower right position inscription block of four, a sealed matched set of blank corners (without inscriptions), the original Canada Post order receipt and a generic letter of apology and explanation telling the collector why they were shorting him three inscription blocks of the four that he had originally ordered (the vast majority of these stamps were recalled due to very poor printing quality). A great potential mini multi-page exhibit. 2017 Unitrade.	$270.00	$100.00
5284
69	Canada #1283a-1286b, 1696a, 1971, 1812, 1812i, 1813, 1813i, 1814, 1814i, 1818-1834, 1-ST, 2-ST, S72.

5427
70	Canada #1363/1760. Well organized collection of 1991 to 1998 period issues, all in mint VF singles, NH complete booklets, panes, souvenir sheets, plate blocks and coil strips. All laid out in two big fat stockbooks. The face values tend to run between 42c and 45c, with numerous higher face values (up to $5.00) noted in the mix. A varied and high quality lot of modern mint material. Total face value	$985.49	$650.00
5055
71	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper sheet margin block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety. 2017 Unitrade.	$800.00	$180.00
1805
72	Canada #1534ii, 1535ii. The rare and unissued 52c and 90c value 1994 Xmas proposed and rejected rate changes, both VF MNH. Fewer than 1,000 examples of the 90c stamp exist. The Post Office intended to increase the postal rates from 50c and 88c but changed their minds at the last minute. Somehow a few of these stamps made it onto the market. Oops! A famous modern "administrative" error. 2017 Unitrade.	$800.00	$525.00
4203
73	Canada #1560c. Dramatic Misperf. Seriously off center example of the 43c "Falls, Montreal River" commemorative from the Group of Seven souvenir sheet. A very rare modern error. Estimate	$200.00	$55.00

The group consists of the key 1997 Year of the Ox, the 1998 Year of the Tiger, the 1999 Year of the Rabbit, the 2000 Year of the Dragon, the 2001 Year of the Snake and the very hard to find 2007 Year of the Pig. The uncut sheets are all still in the original Canada Post mailing tubes. The total official issue price of the six uncut sheets is $146.75. 2017 Unitrade.	$635.00	$130.00
5633
75	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front. A great mate for the Missing Moose variety. Unitrade states only 200 examples have been reported. Priced as four singles. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$230.00
5614
76	Canada #1760a/1976a. Well organized collection of 1998 to 2003 period issues, almost all in mint VF NH singles, complete booklets, panes, souvenir sheets, plate blocks, coil rolls (slightly flattened) and coil strips.

Mint NH collection of 1999 to 2006 period issues (plus a couple from 2010), all archivally stored on hingeless pages in the original Lighthouse album, plus the 1999 issue hard cover Millennium collection book. A comprehensive offering of stamps, souvenir sheets and booklets, all conservatively valued as face value postage only but worth a decent premium as a collection. Total face value	$453.83	$250.00
3398
78	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$95.00
3398
79	Canada #2045i-2048i. Complete set of 2004 "Write Me, Ring Me" issues consisting of four different special cards, each containing souvenir sheet of 2 stamps and a phone card good for 15 minutes. There were only slightly more than 10,000 complete sets of these folders issued in total. Many of the butterfly and dog thematics have since been gobbled up by the topical market. Look for sets to increase greatly in price in the next few years. All still sealed in the original Canada Post packaging. 2018 Unitrade.	$160.00	$75.00
5614
80	Canada #2104/2241a. Well organized collection of 2005 to 2007 period issues, almost all in mint VF NH complete booklets, panes, souvenir sheets, plate blocks and coil strips. All laid out in one big fat stockbook. The face values tend to run between 50c and 52c, with numerous higher face values (up to $1.55) and some "P" (permanent stamps, valued at 85c) noted in the mix. A varied and high quality lot of modern mint material. Total face value	$575.81	$350.00
5229
81	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$90.00
5536
82	Canada #C3i. Fine mint NH plate #2 plate block of eight of the 1932 issue 6c on 5c airmail with the third stamp from the left in the top row (sheet position 4) showing the "swollen breast" constant plate variety. Canada's second airmail plate variety! Valued as the FNH variety plate block of 6 and two regular FNH singles. An eyecatching positional showpiece. Some minor perf separation in the margin noted for accuracy. 2017 Unitrade.	$280.50	$60.00
5038
83	Canada #C5i. VF MNH example of a very distinct example of the scarce yellow brown shade of the 1935 issue 6c Daedalus airmail. Much harder to find than the catalogue value would suggest. A mint Hinged normal (red brown) stamp includes for comparison. 2017 Unitrade.	$111.00	$130.00
4993
84	Canada #C5iv. Pristine and VF mint NH sheet margin example of the 1935 issue 6c red brown "Daedalus in Flight" airmail, with the Unitrade listed shilling stroke "AIR" constant plate flaw (position 10). This particular stamp shows the sharpest example of this undervalued flaw that I've ever encountered. See the illustration in the Unitrade catalogue to see how indistinct the variety usually appears. 2017 Unitrade.	$150.00	$160.00
4247
85	Canada #CL2. Sound, fresh and VF mint OG H (slight adhesion) example of the 1924 issue Laurentide Air Service (25c) green semi-official airmail, rouletted at top. Only 1,220 printed. 2017 Unitrade.	$160.00	$100.00

5233
95	Canada #J1, J2, J4. Fresh and VF mint NH examples of the 1c, 2c and 5c values from the 1906 first issue postage dues. A great start to a complete collection of NH 'dues. Unitrade is $240.00 for the VF NH trio. 2018 Scott US$120.00=	$150.00	$70.00

3912
99	Canada #O7a. The rare "missing period variety" of the 1949 issue OHMS official overprint on the 14c Hydro-electric plant in a lower left plate #1 plate block of 4. The variety is on the lower right stamp in the block (position 47). 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$190.00

5614
102	Canada #O231/O286, OC6-OC9, OCE1-OCE2, OE7, OE10, OE11. Used selection of 42 different 1937 to 1949 GeoVI period 4-hole OHMS official perfins, all laid out on one double sided stocksheet. All valued at the basic Fine used Unitrade price and as the basic perfin position, even though there are a good number of VF stamps in the group as well as a few better positions. Very conservatively catalogued. 2017 Unitrade.	$244.50	$55.00
5614

5614
106	Canada #OX4. Attractively centered and F/VF mint NH example of the 1913 issue brown black officially sealed stamp. Very hard to find Never Hinged. Some dealers/auction houses would be tempted to value this stamp as a "split grade" F/VF at $350.00 (VFNH @$600.00 + FNH @$100.00 ÷ 2 = $350.00). 2017 Unitrade as Fine NH.	$100.00	$36.00

5595
109	Canada - GeoVI Used Definitives on Paper Treasure Trove. Medium sized (looks big to me) U-haul moving carton packed with late 1930s to early 1950s period GeoVI low value definitives, roughly sorted for Mufti, War Issue and Postes/no Postes series stamps. The vast majority are still on close cut single paper and according to the consignor, completely unpicked for cancels. A quick look indicated a decent range of quality CDS, duplex and other cancel types. The total weight of the lot, including the box is 15 kilograms (33 lbs). This could be just the right winter project for the mid-century cancel fan. Estimate	$100.00	$30.00
3701
110	Canada - Meaty Balance of Consignment. Green Lighthouse brand stockbook packed with 1890s to 1990s period mint material, both regular and "Back of the Book" issues.

While there are almost no individual high values in this lot, the total catalogue and retail value will add up to a substantial amount. A great lot for the Canada specialist. Estimate	$250.00	$170.00
4841
111	Canada - Mint Blocks and Booklets. Cigar box packed with VF mint NH quality plate blocks (mostly in sealed matched sets) and intact booklets (late GeoVI era up to the 1990s).

5624
112	Canada - Souvenir Book Duo. A two book lot, first consisting of "Some Canadian Postage Stamps/Quelques Timbres-Postes Canadiens", a dark green hardcover book with embossed gilt text on the cover containing MNH blocks of various 1961-1964 period issues.

I have no idea why these scarce tomes aren't listed in Unitrade. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
4858
113	Canada - Top Quality Modern Used Mix. Exceptional offering of 3,000 VF used on paper commemoratives, consisting of 1,000 x pre-2016 issues, 1,000 x 2016 issues and 1,000 x 2017 issues. Needless to say this type of material is very hard to find now and is only getting harder to find with every passing year. This particular supplier regularly offers us a superior quality mix, with the inevitable bidding war proving their true worth in the modern used Canada marketplace. Unfailingly one of our most popular modern offerings. Estimate	$250.00	$280.00
5435
114	Canada and Worldwide Covers - An eclectic mix of approx 400 covers and postcards (mostly Canadian) but also including a smattering of USA FDC and foreign odds and ends. Includes some better Canadian WWII Military, commercial FDC, UN Forces, and post WWII era German postcards.

4203
115	Canada Covers #27, 27a. Two single rate 6c Large Queen cross border covers, one franked with the dark brown shade of the stamp, the other franked with the yellow brown shade. A nice classic cover duo. 2017 Unitrade.	$250.00	$70.00

To round out this exquisite literary and technical offering is a top of the line Lighthouse black page stockbook, still in the original shrink wrap. These indispensable tools for the serious student of Classic Canada had huge original prices as new and tend to be very hard to find due to extremely small print runs. Estimate	$300.00	$425.00
5271
118	Canada Literature - Pugh Fakes, Forgeries and Counterfeits. Three volume (small 3-ring binders) set of the earlier (#1/#11) releases of Ken Pugh's lifework masterpiece "Reference Manual of BNA Fakes, Forgeries and Counterfeits", 1977 to 1981 period publication dates. This seminal study of Canadian and Provincial fakes includes detailed (for the period) black and white illustrations and an in-depth description of each bogus item (with reference photos of many of the genuine items). I don't know if the run of pages are complete but there are a few hundred loose-leaf pages in total. A hard to find publication. Estimate	$120.00	$44.00
5607
119	Canada Precancels #R-36, R-42, R-45. Premium quality trio of "R" type precancels, clear impressions on VF examples of the 2c green, 5c grey and 10c red brown Small Queens. The Standard Canada Precancel Catalogue notes that a group of this quality is worth a 25% pemium over the base price ($210.00). Note also that there is a break in the wavy line of the precancel on #R-42. 2015 Standard Canada Precancel Catalogue.	$262.50	$110.00
5595

5242
122	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #2. VF used example of the 1860 issue 2½p dull rose "Victoria", perf 14 x 14. Choice quality "Sock on the Nose" #1 numeral cancel in red (New Westminster, RF 5, Very Scarce). A very pretty West Coast Colonial Classic. 2018 Scott US$240.00=	$300.00	$190.00
5641
123	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #8. Fresh, sound and Fine very lightly cancelled example of the 1867 issue 2c on 3p brown Seal of BC, perf 14 x 14. 2018 Scott US$150.00=	$187.50	$80.00

5614
126	Canadian Provinces - New Brunswick #5P. Proof in brown (no specimen overprint) of the 5c Connell on india paper. Internal tear at right (repaired with paper backing) noted for the record. As the actual stamp was never issued to the public, this is the only reasonable way to fill that empty space in your album. 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$130.00
3205
127	Canadian Provinces - New Brunswick #6, 6a. Mint examples of both the red lilac (HR part OG) and brown lilac shades (no gum) of the 1860 issue 1c locomotive. Nice to get both shades at the same time. 2018 Scott US$142.50=	$178.13	$42.00
5614
128	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #1. VF used example of the 1857 issue 1p brown violet on wove paper with mesh. Four full to huge margins, very light and unobtrusive cancel. A great used example of Newfoundland's first stamp. 2018 Scott US$200.00=	$250.00	$80.00

3534
130	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #13. Fine and sound used, lightly cancelled example of the 1860 issue six pence orange "Heraldic Flowers" imperf. A very pretty stamp and the second scarcest issue of all the 1860-1862 imperforate pence stamps. 2018 Scott US$1,100.00=	$1,375.00	$260.00
5614
131	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #20ii, 23i. Superb VF MNH duo of watermarked 1861-1862 Pence issues, consisting of the 6d rose with "58" and 1sh rose with part of "WI" from the "STACEY WISE/1858" manufacturer's watermark. A great start to reconstructing the full watermark with fresh and pristine full OG examples. 2017 Unitrade.	$320.00	$130.00
5614
132	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #25. Sound and Fine mint part OG (disturbed) example of the 1865 issue 5c brown Harp Seal on thin crisp paper. This is the key stamp to this series. 2018 Scott US$600.00=	$750.00	$110.00
5005
133	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #26. Sound and Fine mint OG Hinge Remnant example of the 1868 issue 5c black Harp seal. Some light toning noted for the record. 2018 Scott US$350.00=	$437.50	$40.00
4279
134	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #27. Fresh and Fine mint no gum example of the 1865 issue 10c black Prince Albert on white paper. See the next lot for the other paper type of this issue. 2018 Scott US$375.00=	$468.75	$85.00
4178
135	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #27a. Fine mint no gum example of the 1865 issue 10c black Prince Albert on the scarcer thin yellowish paper. See the previous lot for the other paper type of this issue. 2018 Scott US$425.00=	$531.25	$100.00
4178
136	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #30. Sound fresh and VF mint no gum example of the 1865 issue 13c orange Fishing Schooner. A very decent example of an early decimal issue. 2018 Scott US$250.00=	$312.50	$75.00
4356
137	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Mint quintet of 1868-1893 issues with the Edward, Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria portraits. The 3c blue is probably regummed but all the other stamps are OG Hinged. A much fresher offering of these 19th century classics than is usually found. 2017 Scott US$935.00=	$1,168.75	$100.00
3534
138	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #53, 54, 55.

139	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #75 (x 2), 76. Sound and F/VF mint hinged examples of the 1897 Type I and Type II "ONE CENT" surcharges on the 3c gray lilac Victoria. Note that the lot includes two slightly different shades of #75. 2018 Scott US$480.00=	$600.00	$120.00
3534
140	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #115-126 plus SHADES. Complete mint set of 12 of the 1919 "Trail of the Caribou" WWI commemorative issue plus eleven additional stamps selected for shades. Mostly F/VF mint H, a few NH. All conservatively valued as mint hinged basic shades. This (in my opinion) is the best BNA issued WWI thematic set. See the next lot for the rare Prussian Blue 15c value. 2018 Scott US$326.75=	$408.45	$140.00
4356
141	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #124b. VF mint OG Hinged example of the very rare Prussian Blue shade of the 15c value from the 1919 "Trail of the Caribou" WWI commemorative set. This is a particularly elusive and contentious shade, so it's imperative for this stamp to have a recognized certificate of authenticity. A 2017 Vincent Graves Greene photo certificate which states "genuine in all respects" fits the bill quite nicely. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$400.00
4096
142	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #128. VF used example of the "THREE CENTS" 1920 provisional surcharge on 15c scarlet "Seals", the scarce Type I surcharge with bars 10½ mm apart. Very hard to find used. 2018 Scott US$250.00=	$312.50	$140.00

144	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C3. Fresh and perfectly centered VF mint H example of the 1921 "Halifax" airmail issue, 2¾ mm between "Air" and "Mail". Only 5,560 printed.

5614
145	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C3b. Fresh and F/VF mint NH example of the 1921 Halifax airmail overprint issue, 2¾ mm spacing between "AIR" and "MAIL", with period after "1921".

4437
147	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C12. VF mint Hinged example of the 1932 issue $1.50 DoX surcharge on $1.00 blue airmail. Unitrade for VF MH is $400.00. Big juicy margins all around. A classic Newfie airmail in exceptional condition! 2018 Scott US$275.00=	$343.75	$150.00
3912
148	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #C13-C17, C19, J1, J1a, J2, J2a, J3 (x 2), J4, J4a, J5, J6, J7. Mint hinged Airmails and Postage Dues, 1933-1949 period issues. 2018 Scott US$282.10=	$352.65	$75.00
5070
149	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #24 // 270 plus some airmails and small selections of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Five pages with almost all used, about 150 stamps in total. Mixed condition, some faults. Priced years ago as seen on individual tags beside each stamp but the total here represents prices from 2010 Scott. Older 2010 Scott US$1,297.50=	$1,621.88	$250.00
5607
150	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #1. Mint no gum example of the 1853 issue 1p red brown imperf on blued paper. Great colour with margins clear to just into the frame. Still a key Provincial Classic in sound mint condition. 2018 Scott US$2,500.00=	$3,125.00	$210.00
5614
151	Canadian Provinces - Nova Scotia #6. Fresh and F/VF quality used example of the 1857 issue 1sh reddish purple imperf. Sound, with margins clear to huge on 3½ sides (just touching at upper left). A particularly elusive BNA classic, missing from most collections and great addition to the first page for any Nova Scotia collection. 2018 Scott US$5,250.00=	$6,562.50	$525.00
65
152	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #1. Fresh and F/VF centered mint no gum example of the rare 1861 issue 2p dull rose, typographed on soft unwatermarked paper, perf 9 x 9. A couple of shallow thins noted, as is common with this very delicate paper. Still a much nicer looking than usual offering of his pre-Confederation "first issue". 2018 Scott US$1,100.00=	$1,275.00	$210.00
5614
153	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #3. Fine centered very lightly used example of the scarce 6d yellow green 1861 issue, perforated 9 x 9, printed on soft yellowish paper. Slightly irregular perfs at left and a small tear into the margin at bottom but the almost invisible cancel gives this key pre-Confederation classic a very attractive appearance. 2018 Scott US$1,200.00=	$1,500.00	$220.00
5614
154	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #5, 9, 13, 16. REPRINT PROOFS.

4521
156	Germany #C41 on Graf Zeppelin Post Card. A very scarce flown card franked with the 2 mark ultramarine Graf Zeppelin airmail, overprinted "Polar Fahrt 1931". Put in Berlin drop mail, then posted on board the Graf Zeppelin July 31st, 1931 and flown to the Russian ice breaker "Malygin" in the arctic, where a receiving stamp of July 27th was applied. The card itself is a Byron Harmon black and white real-photo "Bow Lake" and the card is addressed to Banff Alberta (an uncommon final destination). A VF quality piece of postal history from the Golden Age of airships. 2017 Scott Classic for #C41 on card US$350.00=	$437.50	$130.00
5621
157	Germany and German States - Large mint and used collection of pre-Confederation German States from Baden to Thurn and Taxis, with North German Confederation and early German Empire issues as well. A total of 224 stamps with virtually all of the postage-stamp issuing authorities represented (missing only Wurttemberg). Expect some reprints and faults in an original, old time and "offered as received" mix such as this. This group will surely have a massive catalogue value. An excellent lot for the intrepid classic German student and specialist alike. Take a close look at the scans of the four stocksheets to appreciate the range and value of this lot. Estimate	$500.00	$675.00
5621
158	Great Britain #1. Plate #9 on Cover. Sound, fresh and Very Fine single franked December 30th 1840 "Penny Black" (plate 9) cover, Darlington to Stockton (10 miles distance). The stamp is tied with a light and clear Maltese Cross cancel in red. The plate 9 is the one of the scarcer plates of the Penny Black and a cover from late December 1840 fits perfectly with the proper period of issue and use of this plate number of this, the world's first stamp. 2017 Stanley Gibbons Concise £1,200.00=	$1,980.00	$260.00
5586
159	Great Britain #1. The famous 1840 issue Penny Black with a signed (Leon Norman Williams) and numbered (#635) "Certificate of Authenticity and Genuineness", enlarged photo and additional promotional folder from the Excelsior Collector's Guild Ltd. Used with black Maltese Cross cancel. Margin just in at upper right corner, otherwise a sound and certified example of the world's first postage stamp. 2018 Scott US$320.00=	$400.00	$85.00
3121
160	Great Britain #1, 3 (x 9), 4 (x 4). Mixed condition used selection of 1840-1841 period QV imperforates. The Penny Black is creased but is in a very deep black with a vibrant Maltese Cross in red.

4261
161	Great Britain #40 SPECIMEN, 57 (Plate 2) SPECIMEN. Two Victorian era issues (1862 issue 9p straw, 1867 issue 5sh rose), each with SG Concise listed "SPECIMEN" overprints. While both stamps are no gum and have various faults, specimen overprints on these stamps are exceedingly rare (the 9p is SG #86s @ £750.00 and the 5sh is SG #127s @ £1,750.00). 2017 SG Concise £2,500.00=	$4,125.00	$130.00
1496
162	Great Britain #51a (plate 9), 60 (plate 12), 62 (plate 17), 81, 84, 85. Used sextet of early Victorian issues. Expect the odd small fault. 2018 Scott US$800.00=	$1,000.00	$90.00

5402
164	Great Britain #234-291. F/VF mint Hinged complete run of all the 1937 to 1951 GeoVI issues plus additional sideways and inverted watermark types.

All still mounted on the original Stanley Gibbons album pages. 2018 Scott US$422.15=	$527.69	$65.00
347
165	Great Britain #309-312, 371-374, 525-528. Complete run of all three 1955 to 1968 issue QEII "Castle" sets, both mint Hinged and used, with extras. Only valued for the three basic sets (no extras counted). 2018 Scott US$351.15=	$438.95	$130.00

Many thousands of used stamps, from early imperfs to modern including definitives, commemoratives, Channel Islands, Offices Abroad, Wildings, Machins and sundry Back of the Book material. All neatly sorted into glassine envelopes or laid out on manila stocksheets. Didn't see too many high values but the material is of decent quality and the range of issues is useful. Estimate	$100.00	$150.00
2299
168	Great Britain Booklets #BK125, BK145/BK193. VF condition mint selection of 33 different large format "Prestige" type booklets, beginning with the 1969 issue "Stamps for Cooks" and ranging all the way up to the 2010 issue King George V commemorative booklet.

3398
169	Great Britain Booklets - Machin Booklet Goldmine. Clean and varied VF quality accumulation of over 300 mint Machin type intact booklets (including "A" and "B" varieties). Noted some high value issues in the mix but the entire lot has been very conservatively valued as face value postage only. Huge catalogue value if sorted by SG Concise.

These locally produced stamps were issued from 1941 to 1944 and were valid until April 13th 1946. Guernsey and Jersey are considered to be the only parts of British home territory to have been under German occupation during the war. Numerous shades, plate varieties and printings of these exist but the stamps in this lot have all been conservatively valued as the basic common types. 2017 Scott Classic US$118.00=	$147.50	$100.00
4521
171	Great Britain Guernsey - Guernsey WWII Occupation Newspapers. Decent condition selection of 13 issues of the Guernsey Star and the Guernsey Press from 1940-1944. These papers give fascinating insights into what life was like in the Channel Islands under the Nazis, in the only part of the British Isles that were occupied in WWII. The news and editorials about the war, from the German point of view, are particularly interesting. Each of the 13 different newspaper editions are complete, a bit yellowed but in good shape considering their age. Estimate	$130.00	$48.00
4475
172	Great Britain Royalty - Small lot of QEII souvenir issues and Coronation related sets.

This group was purchased back in the early 1990s by Kasimir Bileski at the famous ABNC Archives sales, who then sorted, researched and marketed the material. 263 stamps total, including regular, "Back of the Book" and fiscal issues. While there at first appears to be some duplication, the sets and singles have been identified for the different ABNC printing orders that they come from. The lot includes Bileski's extensive original detailed and informative sales blurbs noting that very few of some of the sets of these postal and fiscal issue Specimens and proofs exist. Original 1994 Bileski retail price for this lot	$800.00	$350.00

One batch is neatly mounted on linen hinged quadrille pages (owner's 2014 SG catalogue estimate £160.00), the other batch are all neatly organized in a white-page Stanley Gibbons stockbook (owner's Scott catalogue $400.00 CDN). Minor duplication, not many complete sets in the earlier material, excellent basis for expansion. Owner's total catalogue value	$664.00	$55.00
5538

163
181	New Zealand #79/164, MR1. Four trimmed album pages containing 75 mostly used (some mint hinged) 1898-1919 period issues. Great beginning to start on this country or could fill in some gaps in an existing collection. 2018 Scott US$1,535.62=	$1,919.53	$120.00
5024
182	New Zealand #AR32/AR86. Trimmed album page with a selection of 20 mostly used Postal Fiscal issues. Two are mint hinged. Could be small faults but these don't show up too often on our bidboard. 2018 Scott US$1,055.10=	$1,318.88	$150.00

2050
115	Canada Covers - BC British Columbia Japanese Internment Camp 1944/1945. Trio of covers sent by Japanese Internees during the second world war. Two of the covers originated in Tashme, BC while the third was sent from Greenwood, BC. All three covers are addressed to the BC branch office of New York Life Insurance, and bear the straight line Canadian Censor handstamp. Beginning after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and lasting until 1949 (four years after World War II had ended), Canadians of Japanese heritage were removed from their homes and businesses and sent to internment camps in the B.C. interior, and to farms and internment camps across Canada. Camp living conditions were usually poor, and Tashme, on Highway 3 just east of Hope, was notorious for the camp's particularly harsh conditions. An interesting trio of postal history items, seldom seen in today's market. Estimate	$500.00	$210.00
4203
116	Canada Covers - British Columbia Airways CL-44 Semi Official Airmail stamp on non-philatelic commercial flight cover between Victoria and Vancouver.

The inaugural flight for this airmail service was on August 3rd (return trip starting in Victoria), after a experimental flight on July 23rd. The AAMC catalogue states that "Regular flights occurred after August 3rd on a daily basis until the single aircraft operated by the company was lost at sea on August 25th. Cover franked with CL-44 dated between August 4th and August 25th carry a premium over the value shown for the inaugural flight." An interesting BC airmail item! Scan shows both front and back of cover. Estimate	$200.00	$130.00
3850
117	Canada Covers - Duo of interrupted mail items. The first cover from Toronto on April 7th 1954 to Vancouver, with a back stamp which reads "Salvaged From T.C.A. Wreck". This cover was on board the infamous "Moose Jaw" on April 8th in which a Royal Canadian Air Force Harvard trainer collided with a Trans-Canada Air Line North Star passenger plane in the skies over Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, scattering wreckage and debris over a three-mile radius in the city's northeast end. The cover has the tell tale singe marks from the mail bags catching fire. Of note, the cover bears a 5c QEII Wilding Issue stamp perfined NYL (New York Life), and would make an interesting addition to any QEII or Perfin collection. The second cover of the lot originated in Beverly Hills, California destined for London, Ontario and bears the handstamp "Damaged in Railroad Fire." This interesting cover needs some research to find out more about the Railway incident, but may be a diamond in the rough for a philatelic sleuth. Estimate	$150.00	$28.00
4877
118	Canada Literature - "The Post Offices of British Columbia 1858-1970". This is the original masterwork listing of BC Post Offices by George H. Melvin.

Face values tend to be between 8c and 45c but saw some higher denominations also. Clean and useful! Total face value.	$674.00	$350.00
5624
100	Canada - Used Massive Motherlode. Neatly sorted (in #10 envelopes and on stockseets) hoard of over 51,000 used stamps (51,755 by the consignor's count), consisting of 1870s period to recent issues. While the very early material is a bit thin, the lot becomes more and more comprehensive with each succeeding decade. A spot check of a sampling of the material (many of the stamps are in envelopes) showed the quality to be quite nice. This lot is quite voluminous but will potentially be a very rewarding re-sorting project for those long winter months. Estimate	$400.00	$300.00
5630
101	Canada and Sundry - Mint Hinged and used mixed condition 19th to mid-20th Century assortment of Canada (84 stamps) and varied Worldwide (122 stamps). All laid out on three Vario/Hagner type sheets and one double sided Vario for inspection. The bulk of the sound material is in the Canadian material. Huge theoretical total catalogue value. Take a good look at the scans to determine the overall quality for yourself. Estimate	$150.00	$44.00
5608
102	Canada Cancels - Newfoundland Selection. Well organized selection of around 700 clean and legible cancels, all laid out on five double sided stocksheets. Some are on stamp alone and some are on postal piece. Most are CDS and split-ring types from the 1950s to 1980s. Some duplication to be expected but the lot includes many different strikes and types. Post offices from "A to S" are noted. According to the owner, this group represents "a nice group of seldom offered better quality Newfoundland and a few Labrador". Owner's Estimate.	$250.00	$110.00
4324
103	Canada Precancels - UNLISTED ONE OF A KIND NEW FIND. Spectacular VF centered 1c deep green 1930 issue GeoV Arch/Leaf showing a very clear example of the MAJOR RE-ENTRY in the right-hand "1", with a type 7 Montreal QUE precancel, DOUBLE, ONE INVERTED. This precancel is presently UNLISTED in the Marasco & Field Standard Canada Precancel Catalogue (7th edition) but would theoretically have the catalogue designation Montreal Style 7-163b-M (or Montreal Style 7-163ii-M if you take the re-entry into consideration). New finds of precancels are few and far between, considering how much dedicated research has gone into their study. This piece is unquestionably a rarity of the highest order, very possibly unique. Estimate	$1,000.00	$1,000.00

This particular variety is currently unpriced in Unitrade, but the other major re-entry for this stamp (15Aiii) is valued at $500.00 for VF mint, $350.00 for Fine mint.

90	Canada #1535ii. VF MNH example of the unissued 90c 1994 Xmas "Carolling". This stamp was prepared for use in anticipation of a rate change that never came about. A few of these 90c values got out accidentally. Only an estimated 1,000 examples were "released". 2017 Unitrade.	$600.00	$210.00

5233
92	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH.

The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed.

126	Canada Covers - Gilles Villeneuve Error FDC. Here's your chance to acquire a very rare UNOPENED post office pack of four Formula 1 commemorative FDCs, including the rare Gilles Villeneuve error cover. Only days after their initial release, all of the Gilles Villeneuve official first-day covers (OFDCs) were recalled in panic because Villeneuve's birthplace, found on the reverse of the OFDC, was incorrectly identified. Instead of Villeneuve's actual birthplace of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qué., his birthplace is erroneously listed as Berthierville, Qué., which is about 120 kilometres north of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. A total of 11,000 Villeneuve OFDCs were originally printed and issued on May 15th but the vast majority were recalled within days, with very few, if any, reaching postal counters. A new version is available now online to pre-order with delivery and in post offices by mid-June. A potential modern FDC rarity of the highest order. Estimate	$150.00	$130.00

5023
197	USA #3409-3413. VF mint NH complete set of all five 2000 issue "Space" themed high value souvenir sheets.

165	Italy - Aegean Islands Group. Useful and varied selection of 235 lightly duplicated (usually for mint and used) 1912-1934 period issues on five Hagner stocksheets. The lot consists of overprinted and specialized stamps for use in these Mediterranean islands after they had been occupied by Italy. Mainly mint hinged, with some used also noted. The General Issue, laid out on one page, includes two of the Soccer issues of 1934 which are used but because the cancels are indistinct and light it may be that they were cancelled by favour. As such they have been conservatively valued as mint (we are not sufficiently expert in the issue to certify that they are postally used). If they are subsequently expertized and determined to be used the catalogue value of the lot increases by US$465.00! All the different islands are represented.

All mounted and priced on pages. 2017 Unitrade.	$638.05	$90.00
5614
70	Canada #522ii, 525i. VF mint NH examples of the 5c and 6c identical centre blocks from the 1970 Xmas "Childrens' Drawings" issue. Scarce blocks, listed in many catalogues and illustrated in many albums. The 5c block shows the "M.A" variety (#522iii) and the 6c block is WITHOUT the "scratch through window" variety (much scarcer than a block with the variety and worth a 50% premium as such). 2017 Unitrade.	$100.00	$30.00
4814
71	Canada #586/605. Small but useful and valuable high quality VF mint NH collection of 1c to $2.00 value 1972-1977 period "Caricature/Landscape" definitives, all neatly mounted on computer generated 3-ring album pages. Includes lots of Ken Rose/Adminware tagging errors as well as numerous Unitrade listed varieties. See the scans of the album pages to see the identified and priced material as well as the unpriced/unlisted material. A great lot for the student of this popular and richly rewarding series. Estimate	$275.00	$210.00
5573
72	Canada #727. VARIETY. VF MNH sheet margin example of the 1979 issue $2.00 Kluane with doubled embossing of the "$2 CANADA". One impression is in the regular silver ink, the other impression is albino. A very noticeable and as of yet uncatalogued variety. Other high value National Parks issues have Unitrade listed double embossing varieties (for example #937iii @ $350.00). Some black offset from the printers noted on the gum side for accuracy's sake. Estimate	$150.00	$65.00
5614
73	Canada #727a. VF mint NH example of the 1979 issue $2.00 Kluane with the missing silver inscriptions error. Only 500-600 examples of this error exist. Normal stamp included for comparison. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$210.00
5614

3266
75	Canada #953a. MNH imperforate strip of three of the 1987 issue 36c dark red Parliament coil. This is one of the scarcer modern imperfs. Valued as 1.5 x the price of a pair. 2017 Unitrade.	$562.50	$130.00
5614
76	Canada #1407ai. Two examples of the famous Canada '92 "Signature Sheet", both VF MNH. Only 10,000 sheets issued. Printed for the CANADA '92 program, these souvenir sheets are printed on a distinctive paper stock and bear the marginal signature "Paul de Chomedy, Sieur de Maisonneuve". Listed in all major catalogues and illustrated in most albums. Needless to say missing from most collections. A nice little investment duo. 2017 Unitrade.	$250.00	$85.00
4582
77	Canada #1442vi. VF MNH block of 20 of the 1992 "Canada in Space" issue with the scarce "Meteor Shower" variety on the holograms of 4 stamps in the second column. This shows up as dotted horizontal streaks of black on the lower half of the hologram and is strongest on position 6 in this block, with 2 clear lines of streaks. Valued conservatively as the single varieties only. 2017 Unitrade.	$800.00	$240.00
5614
78	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper left position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A very rare modern variety inscription block. 2017 Unitrade.	$950.00	$350.00
4355
79	Canada #1812i, 1813i, 1814i. 20 complete sets of all three 1999-2000 Millennium souvenir sheets of one. All VF MNH. (Face value is $41.08). These panes were only available in the "Millennium Keepsake" tin and are harder to find than the panes of four. 2017 Unitrade.	$450.00	$80.00
5389
80	Canada #1814i. Wholesale/investment lot of 100 VF MNH examples of the 1999 issue 95c brown "Dove of peace on branch" Millennium commemorative souvenir sheet of one. This particular sheet was only available in the Official Millennium Keepsake box. Total face value $95.00 but worth more due to relative scarcity. 2017 Unitrade.	$750.00	$75.00
3414
81	Canada #1867b. Worthwhile investment lot of 40 VF mint NH examples of the rare "inverted die cutting" variety of the 2000 issue 46c Petro-Canada self-adhesive commemorative. These stamps were only available in the 2000 Annual Collection or in Canada Post philatelic Quarterly Packs. An elusive modern "sleeper" issue, sure to increase in value. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$46.00
4819
82	Canada #1971. VF mint NH wholesale group of twenty of the 2003 issue "NHL All Stars" souvenir sheets, each pane containing 6 x 48c stamps, each stamp depicting a different NHL All Star. This pane and the self-adhesive pane issued at the same time are the key panes from the popular NHL series. 2017 Unitrade.	$390.00	$65.00
5233
83	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$85.00
5614
84	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued. A real "sleeper" item, undervalued in Unitrade. Normal sheet included for comparison. Note that this imperforate variety ALWAYS sells for well over catalogue. 2017 Unitrade.	$194.00	$140.00
4295
85	Canada #BK111A. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2017 Unitrade.	$500.00	$36.00
5526
86	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$80.00
3613
87	Canada #C1-C9. Fresh and VF mint NH complete set of 1928-1948 airmail issues. A very attractive quality mint run. Unitrade is $405.25 for a VF mint NH set. 2018 Scott US$215.00=	$268.75	$90.00
870
88	Canada #E1. A richly and wonderfully fresh and pristine VF mint NH example of the 1898 issue 10c blue green Special Delivery stamp. This stamp is very hard to find NH, especially this nice! Unitrade is $1,000.00 for a stamp of this quality. 2018 Scott US$350.00=	$437.50	$375.00
5577

5614
90	Canada #E3. VF mint left hand sheet margin plate block of six of the 1927 issue 20c orange "Confederation" Special Delivery. The inscription reads "Ottawa No. A-1 9430". Lightly hinged on the upper right stamp only, the other five stamps are all perfect mint NH. Conservatively valued as 1 x VF H stamp and 5 x VF NH stamps. 2017 Unitrade.	$810.00	$220.00
4464
91	Canada #E4. VF MNH upper sheet margin example of the 1930 issue 20c henna brown "TWENTY CENTS" Special Delivery stamp. This design was deemed to be too unilingual (the text in the value tablet was in English only). The #E5 corrected this problem. Unitrade is $200.00 for VF NH. Great colour, huge Jumbo margins, perfect gum. 2018 Scott US$125.00=	$156.25	$80.00
5614
92	Canada #E8. VF mint NH lower left plate #1 plate block of four of the 1938 issue 20c Special Delivery stamp. Listed as a plate block of 4 in Unitrade. 2017 Unitrade.	$481.25	$130.00

These issues were intended to be affixed to annual hunting licenses. Each stamp is a beautiful example of wildlife art by Canada's leading artists. Total original face value of the blocks is $64.00. Plate blocks are much scarcer than the booklet formats of these stamps. 2017 Unitrade.	$450.00	$42.00
5233
95	Canada #J1-J5, J6-J10. Fresh and F-VF complete mint sets of the 1906-1932 "First" and "Second" issue postage dues all OG Hinged. 2018 Scott US$409.50=	$511.88	$80.00
5408
96	Canada #J3. Post Office fresh and VF MNH example of the 4c violet "first issue" postage due. A lovely stamp and a key early 'due. Unitrade is $200.00 for VF MNH. 2018 Scott US$110.00=	$137.50	$75.00

105	Canada #O47i. VF MNH positional block of 9 of the 1963 issue 2c green Cameo with G official overprint, the middle stamp in the block showing the Unitrade listed "blunt G" variety (position 39). An undervalued variety. 2017 Unitrade.	$91.12	$60.00
5613
106	Canada - Annual Collection for 1974. The first 8½"x 11" large format (and key issue) Canada Post Annual Collection. The VF mint NH stamps are neatly mounted in black hingeless mounts. The lot includes the original Canada Post envelope (mailed by Registered mail from Moosomin SK). All in all in very decent shape, considering how few of these books have survived intact. 2017 Unitrade.	$250.00	$50.00
3543
107	Canada - Annual Collections for 1975, 1976 and 1977. Choice and VF+ quality trio of early Canada Post soft cover yearbooks containing the MNH stamp issues for these three years. The 1975 issue in particular is very elusive, especially this nice. 2017 Unitrade.	$210.00	$80.00
5604
108	Canada - Better Modern Mint Mix. Small box containing a nicely sorted selection of mint NH 1950s to 1990s period issues, with significant duplication of some. Noted the 46c ATM pane, 4 x Eatons booklets (in original wrapping), $1.00 Vancouver issues, plus semi-sorted glassines of duplicated VF mint NH definitives and commemoratives. Conservatively valued as face value postage but many better items make this a "plus value" lot. Total Face value	$662.23	$400.00
5614
109	Canada - Misused Mint Mass Mess. Medium sized carton packed with a massive but very tragic hoard of mint material, Queen Victoria through QEII period issues (mostly late GeoVI and QEII). ALL STUCK TOGETHER DUE TO IMPROPER STORAGE IN AN ATTIC FOR DECADES. Noted some very good stamps and plate blocks in the mix with an absolutely obscene total theoretical catalogue value in the many thousands of dollars if they were all NH. Still a worthwhile (major) soaking project, with literally hundreds of dollars of still useable face value present (even excluding the damaged stamps) in the mix. Some of the stacks of stuck plate blocks are over an inch thick! Set aside a few weeks at least for the soaking part and you'll need at least a dozen glue sticks if you want to use the recovered stamps on mail. Estimate	$250.00	$170.00
5624
110	Canada - Modern uncancelled on paper. On paper Canada uncancelled postage stamps, consisting of 574 x "P" (presently 85c) mostly "Beaver" and "Flag over" definitive issues. Unchecked for shades and types. Offered as received. Total face value of the uncancelled stamps.	$487.90	$160.00
5624

Contains a VF MNH set of blocks of #311-314, the Canadian Stamp Centenary issue. Very limited issue and a key addition to any Souvenir Book collection. Only listed (and in our opinion severely underpriced) in the 2005 Darnell catalogue. As an added bonus, the lot includes a set of special cacheted covers, each one carried from Richmond Hill ON by different means (locomotive, helicopter, stagecoach and native runner). Valued as the book only. Undervalued 2005 Darnell catalogue.	$125.00	$55.00
3398
112	Canada Cover #140. Registered Cover. A natural straight bottom strip of five and a single (#140) paying the registration and forward fees, tied by Calgary 03 Jan 1927 CDS on a cover to Vancouver.

VF mint no gum as issued upper left corner sheet margin imperforate pair of the 2c green KGV definitive with "4" plate number in the selvedge at left.

5614
77	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH lower right position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp.

5614
78	Canada #1534ii. VF MNH example of the 1994 Xmas unissued 52c value. The Post Office intended to increase the rate from 50c but changed their minds at the last minute. A few sheets of the proposed 52c somehow got out. A rare modern "administrative" error. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$130.00
5614

3912
80	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8. This special and limited edition sheet was only available in the "Chinatown Gates Collection" and was overlooked as a major modern variety by most collectors. Only 8,888 issued.

4901
81	Canada #2962b. VF quality group of twenty used examples of the 63c Woodchuck "Baby Wildlife" definitive, all without the repeating CANADA underprint. A modern "sleeper" variety, proving to be very elusive. The Unitrade catalogue valuation ($10.00 each) is in italics which means that the actual rarity of this variety has not yet been established. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$22.00
5610

5614
88	Canada #E1iv. Archivally fresh and Fine MNH upper sheet margin example of the deep blue green shade of the 1898 issue 10c Special Delivery. This stamp has been cared for and coddled since the day it was printed! Valued as a basic #E1 by Scott. 2018 Scott US$350.00=	$472.50	$110.00
5614

The overprinted 5c, 20c and 50c Admirals have been valued by Unitrade ($350.00 cat) and the balance have been valued by basic Scott catalogue (US$485.05 cat). Expect the odd small fault, but the coil pairs (which command a premium in Unitrade) have only been valued as 2 singles each. Combined 2018 Scott and 2017 Unitrade.	$1,004.82	$150.00
5596
92	Canada #MR2a. VF MNH example of the scarce Unitrade listed rose carmine shade of the 1915 issue 2c KGV War Tax. A great little stamp. 2017 Unitrade.	$150.00	$75.00

4246

VF used example of the 1938 Pictorial issue 20c Fort Garry with 5-hole "OHMS" official perfins, doubly perforated in position C (Wrigley's position CX), additionally with the "missing pin in S" variety (Die 2 in the original perforating machines).

Subtle slant on the second set of perfins, appears to be Dies 3 and 4 of the original perforating machine. Unitrade value is $440.00 for the most common position. Estimate	$300.00	$250.00
4071

2712

113	Canada Covers - Gilles Villeneuve Error FDC. Here's your chance to acquire a very rare UNOPENED post office pack of four Formula 1 commemorative FDCs, including the rare Gilles Villeneuve error cover. Only days after their initial release, all of the Gilles Villeneuve official first-day covers (OFDCs) were recalled in panic because Villeneuve's birthplace, found on the reverse of the OFDC, was incorrectly identified. Instead of Villeneuve's actual birthplace of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qué., his birthplace is erroneously listed as Berthierville, Qué., which is about 120 kilometres north of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. A total of 11,000 Villeneuve OFDCs were originally printed and issued on May 15th but the vast majority were recalled within days, with very few, if any, reaching postal counters.

5595
120	Canada Revenues #FX41a. Sound and Fine used example of the exceedingly rare (Van Dam only notes one other reported) 8c blue 2-leaf Excise Tax with RAILWAY TIES PRECANCEL. It goes without saying that this stamp is missing from most (probably all but one) Canadian revenue stamp collections. 2009 Van Dam.	$950.00	$475.00
5282
121	Canada Revenues #YL13b. Yukon Law Stamp Error on Document. Extremely rare VF used example of the closely spaced yet distinctly evident double printing of the silver overprinted Law stamp, punch cancelled on complete 1949 Territorial Court affidavit demanding payment from the Consolidated Gold Corp. Ltd. Van Dam notes that even the basic #YL13 on document is very scarce. We had originally thought that YL13b used on document might be a unique piece but we have since heard of two others in existence. Thus we have changed our opinion from possibly unique to just screamingly rare. Conservatively catalogued as a used stamp only. 2009 Van Dam.	$750.00	$210.00
2168
122	Canada, Newfoundland, Australia - Balance of Consignment.

5604
123	Canadian Provinces - British Columbia #7. Fresh and Very Fine mint no gum wing margin example of the 1865 issue 3p "Seal of BC", perf 14 x 14. Quite well centered for this notoriously off-centre issue. 2018 Scott US$160.00=	$216.00	$55.00

5410
126	Canadian Provinces - New Brunswick #5P. Proof in brown (no specimen overprint) of the 5c Connell on india paper. A couple of small internal paper flaws noted for the record. As the actual stamp was never issued to the public, this is the only reasonable way to fill that empty space in your album. A careful washing and pressing will improve the look of this scarce and popular proof. 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$140.00
5115
127	Canadian Provinces - Newfoundland #41, 43-49, 51, 52, 54. Eleven Mint Hinged (a few with little or no gum) generally F/VF stamps from the 1880-1896 period issue. Owner's 2016 Scott US$940.00=	$1,269.00	$160.00

71	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper right position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp.

3912
73	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$80.00

4302
79	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition (one with light pencil notation on back). These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$150.00	$90.00
4495

82	Canada #E4. VF MNH example of the 1930 issue 20c henna brown "TWENTY CENTS" Special Delivery stamp. This design was deemed to be too unilingual (the text in the value tablet was in English only).

Contains a VF MNH set of blocks of #311-314, the Canadian Stamp Centenary issue. Very limited issue and a key addition to any Souvenir Book collection.

Valued as the book only. Undervalued 2005 Darnell catalogue	$125.00	$80.00
269
96	Canada - Souvenir book "Some Canadian Postage Stamps". Dark green hardcover book with embossed gilt text on cover containing MNH blocks of various 1961-1964 period issues. Note that this book is the 1965 revised edition.

5397
117	China - PRC #506-517. VF used premium quality complete set of twelve of the famous 1960 Goldfish pictorials. All sound and fresh. The stamps have probably been washed off of First Day Covers, as the cancels are not the same as the usual CTO types. 2017 Scott US$85.50=	$115.43	$34.00

Very mixed condition as is usual with these older collections. Included are images taken from the original album pages, to indicate the plate numbers.

4005
98	Canada #F3. F/VF mint OG H example of the dull blue 1876 issue 8c Registration stamp. Much nicer quality than we usually see. 2017 Scott US$600.00=	$810.00	$260.00

The semi-key 1975 annual collection, in excellent condition and in the original envelope (envelope a bit grubby) with promotional booklet (unusual) and stamps still sealed in the original glassine envelope.

4858
110	Canada Revenues #BCL46-BCL50. British Columbia Law Stamps. Five fresh and VF complete mint sets of five of the 1958 issue BC Centennial series Law stamps. Note that some of the stamps have full perforations all around (scarce thus, as the panes created mostly straight-edged stamps and Van Dam notes that fully perfed stamps from this series are worth a premium).

4241
56	Canada #161i. F/VF MNH paste-up strip of four of the 1929 issue 2c green KGV Scroll coil. Many would consider this as VF due to the nature of paste-ups but this strip has been split-graded as F/VF. 2017 Unitrade.	$345.00	$110.00

Only 8,500 sheets printed. Note that Unitrade now also lists and values all the various combinations of gutter strips, blocks and plates. The face value of the stamps in the sheet is $54.00. Undervalued in Unitrade as a sheet. 2017 Unitrade.	$100.00	$42.00

VF MNH complete run of all the 1999-2000 Millennium miniature sheets including the basic set of 17 panes plus the additional six "Dove" thematic panes of 4 and 1.

3784
71	Canada #1838, 1885, 1935, 1971-1972, 2017-2018, 2085-2086. Complete run of all the 2000-2005 NHL All Stars hockey sheets including the three self-adhesive miniature booklet panes. All VF MNH.

5233
72	Canada #1867b. Worthwhile investment lot of 50 VF mint NH examples of the rare "inverted die cutting" variety of the 2000 issue 46c Petro-Canada self-adhesive commemorative.

74	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$85.00
5472
75	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c.

3398
76	Canada #2357iii, 2426iii. Scarce VF quality mint uncut press panels of 100 of two different self-adhesive "P" (permanent) die cut coils, consisting of the 2010 issue "Striped Coralroot" and the 2011 issue "Arctic Hare". These uncut panes were in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very scarce modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the two sheets is $170.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2017 Unitrade is not particularly consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. The "Striped Coralroot" sheet has a light corner bend noted for the record. 2017 Unitrade.	$340.00	$160.00
4841
77	Canada #2642ii, 2642. VF mint NH 2013 issue "Chinatown Gates" IMPERFORATE souvenir sheet of 8.

These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$200.00	$110.00
5329
80	Canada #C1-C4. Fresh mint 2 NH/2 H blocks of 4 of the first four airmail issues of 1928-1932, hinged on top pairs with NH bottom pairs. 2017 Scott US$747.00=	$1,008.45	$42.00

Mostly 5c to 17c values but noted some GeoV period issues in many of the packs as well as some higher catalogue value stamps in the more modern material. The stamps are probably also unchecked for paper, gum or other varieties. A fun mix for the philatelic envelope festooner with the added bonus of some better items in the mix.

5233

3740
57	Canada #276 // 716. Mint stock of 1948-1978 period issues, all neatly sorted in glassine envelopes, identified and priced by Unitrade. The lot consists of mainly commemoratives and Christmas issues, 6,164 stamps in total, including numerous tagged stamps. The stamps are mostly in blocks and blank corner blocks. This stock will have a high total Unitrade catalogue value but the lot has been very conservatively valued for the face value of the mint postage alone. A great lot for the collector/dealer needing organized and clean stock from this time period. Total face value.	$461.92	$260.00
1805
58	Canada #338-340. Stunning VF mint collection of matched sets of plate blocks of the 2c green, 3c carmine rose and 4c violet QEII Wilding issue values with a few used sets with Winnipeg barrel cancels and a few LH blocks noted but the vast majority checked were pristine NH.

The semi-annotated collection includes ten rate covers of various types, a FDC and numerous plate blocks. Of special mention is a quantity of correspondence, numerous papers and order cards from the Canadian Bank Note Company and the Canadian Post Office Department regarding the stamp design, production and finished stamp orders. Great background documentation for the serious collector of Elizabethan period material. Estimate	$250.00	$260.00
65
60	Canada #406, 406i, 406ii, etc.. Valuable and VF MNH specialized collection of the 1963 issue 2c green QEII Cameo coil consisting of 2 pairs, one strip of 4, a jump strip of 4, a jump strip of 4 with cutting guidelines visible, a repair paste-up pair and a repair paste-up strip of 4 with cutting guidelines. This last strip is unlisted as such in Unitrade and is an extremely scarce item. This value especially is surprisingly difficult to find well centered and this lot represents a particularly choice lot for any Elizabethan or coil issue specialist. 2017 Unitrade over	$350.00	$85.00
5400
61	Canada #458b, 458bi, 458bp. VF MNH set of all 3 varieties of the miniature pane of 20 of the 5c blue QEII Centennial issue, on both the DF and the NF paper stock as well as Winnipeg 2 Bar Tagged.

63	Canada #1040, 1131, 1680, 1815. VARIETIES. Archivally fresh and pristine mint NH quartet of dramatic and eye-catching perforation shifts, creating two recognized tagging errors as well (#1040 T1, G2aC and #1815 T1, G4dV). Estimate	$300.00	$130.00
5416
64	Canada #1194B. FORGERY. Counterfeit imperforate full mint NH sheet of 110 of the 1990 issue 39c dark violet Flag coil. This fake was produced in Montreal back in the early 1990s with the intention of defrauding the post office but the ring was broken up by the RCMP before production was complete. A few sheets and strips of these forgeries ended up on the philatelic market a short while later. A modern Canadian faux-philatelic conversation piece! Estimate	$500.00	$85.00

5526
67	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH upper left position inscription block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date. A few of these 52c stamps somehow got out of the post office and into private hands. A rare modern variety inscription block. 2017 Unitrade.	$950.00	$400.00
4178
68	Canada #1535ii. VF MNH example of the unissued 90c 1994 Xmas "Carolling". This stamp was prepared for use in anticipation of a rate change that never came about. A few of these 90c values got out accidentally. Only an estimated 1,000 examples were "released". 2017 Unitrade.	$600.00	$350.00

5526
70	Canada #1812i, 1813i, 1814i. 20 complete sets of all three 1999-2000 Millennium souvenir sheets of one. All VF MNH. (Face value is $41.08). These panes were only available in the "Millennium Keepsake" tin and are harder to find than the panes of four. 2017 Unitrade.	$450.00	$55.00
5233
71	Canada #2244, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2304, 2357. Seven different "P" (permanent stamps, present face value 85c each) stamp issues, all in mint no gum glassine envelopes of 100 of each. Offered as received. Total face value of the no gum stamps	$595.00	$85.00

5445
74	Canada #BK106-BK109. VF condition intact mint NH quartet of 1989 issue Christmas booklets consisting of the 33c ($3.30), 38c ($3.80), 44c ($2.20) and 76c ($3.80) value booklets. This is a particularly scarce series of booklets, all still sealed. 2017 Unitrade.	$142.00	$38.00
5444
75	Canada #BK111A. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2017 Unitrade.	$500.00	$60.00

76	Canada #BK118. Wholesale lot of 20 complete mint NH $9.75 "Moving the Mail" booklets, a 1990 issue "Prestige" style booklet containing 25 x 39c Canada Post Mail Van commemoratives, all laid out in various combinations (inward and outward facing vans).

2168
77	Canada #BK251Aa.

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was not included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). The unsevered booklet of thirty is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $43.20. A "sleeper" booklet type and scarce Olympic topical. 2017 Unitrade.	$180.00	$55.00
3398
78	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. His booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Owner's estimate	$200.00	$70.00
3398
79	Canada #C1-C9, CO1, CO2, OC8. Mostly mint collection of 1928-1946 issue Airmails including multiples, a plate block and booklet pane plus a smattering of perforated and overprinted officials. A beautiful complete group with some choice NH items noted. 2017 Scott US$402.00=	$542.70	$36.00

Elliot 25c red on yellow (zig-zag lines), with the lower right stamp showing a very prominent example of the Unitrade listed "white spot" variety (position 8 LR).

3634

A worthwhile group. 2017 Scott US$751.00=	$1,013.85	$85.00
4406
82	Canada #J1 // J20. Mint and used selection of 1906-1965 issue "purple" postage dues, all laid out on Vario brand stocksheets, including inscription blocks and other multiples. The odd small fault is to be expected. A great lot for the "Back of the Book" specialist, all conservatively valued by basic Scott catalogue types. 2017 Scott US$765.90=	$1,033.97	$75.00
3634
83	Canada #O32. Pristine and VF mint NH trio of 1953 issue $1.00 Totem plate #2 plate blocks, all with "G" official overprints.

5574
56	Canada #153a. Superlative VF mint NH booklet pane of 6 of the 5c deep violet KGV "Scroll" issue of 1929, excellent centering and freshness, with natural diagonal gum skip on reverse not detracting. A lovely example of the key post-Admiral KGV booklet pane. 2017 Unitrade is $525.00 for a VFNH pane. 2017 Scott US$280.00=	$378.00	$95.00
5038
57	Canada #166a. Perfectly centered and Post Office fresh VF mint NH booklet pane of 4 (plus 2 labels) of the 1931 issue 2c dark brown KGV Arch/Leaf (Die II). An exceptional quality example of a key early booklet pane. 2017 Scott $200.00=	$270.00	$130.00

2299
71	Canada #1180ci. VF used example of the 1990 issue 80c "Peary Caribou", missing the dark blue at top and violet background. Looks OK but sold "as is". Regular used stamp included for comparison. 2017 Unitrade.	$2,000.00	$230.00
65
72	Canada #1283a-1286b. Eight complete sets of all four 1990 issue Petro Canada 39c "Majestic Forests" mini-panes of four, all VF MNH. These panes were produced as a special promotion for Petro Canada. Getting hard to find. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$90.00
5526
73	Canada #1431a. Mini-investment lot of twelve MNH 1992 issue Canada Day se-tenant panes of 12 x 42c stamps plus 13 labels. Total face value of the sheets is $60.48 but these wholesale for considerably higher than face value. Noted the odd small edge fault on a couple of sheets. 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$65.00
5233
74	Canada #1693ii. VF MNH pane of 4 of the $5.00 Moose "Extra Moose" variety consisting of a strong offset of the brown Moose, showing a clear impression facing left on the gummed side instead of facing right as on the front.

5024
75	Canada #1867b. Worthwhile investment lot of 50 VF mint NH examples of the rare "inverted die cutting" variety of the 2000 issue 46c Petro-Canada self-adhesive commemorative. These stamps were only available in the 2000 Annual Collection or in Canada Post philatelic Quarterly Packs. An elusive modern "sleeper" issue, sure to increase in value. 2017 Unitrade.	$500.00	$75.00
5155
76	Canada #1881a. INVERTED DIE CUT. VF mint full pane of 6 of the 2000 issue $1.05 White-tailed Deer with the die cutting completely inverted. The invert error booklet was purchased in Edmonton and while presently unlisted in Unitrade, the fact that there are only 3 booklets reported will make this a major rarity. Nicely written-up with a normal pane included for comparison. Buy it now before it gets listed for many thousands! Estimate	$1,000.00	$825.00
2740
77	Canada #1965, 1965a. ODJIG SIGNED GOLDMINE. Extremely scarce group of Daphne Odjig artist signed stamp booklets, First Day Covers and stamp pane, all of the 48c "Genesis" stamp from the 2002 Christmas issue set of three. Items relating to this particular issue are very rare signed by Odjig due to her fragile health at the time ("Genesis" was a 1976 work). The lot of signed items consists of ten intact booklets of 10, two FDCs with inscription blocks, a full sheet of 25 signed in the lower margin, a signed card with the image and a Canada Post announcement pertaining to the stamp issue celebration in Kamloops, November 18th 2002. Daphne Odjig (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Odjig) was a world-renowned, award winning aboriginal artist, born in the Wikwemikong First Nation on Manitoulin Island, ON in 1919. She passed away in Kelowna BC in October of 2016. Here's your chance to acquire an investment quality "artist signed" group, these particular pieces signed as a special favour for a family member. Possibly a unique offering. Estimate	$400.00	$375.00
4005
78	Canada #1991C-1991D. Two complete 2003 issue Canada-Alaska Cruise Ship Sheets. Both sheets are Post Office fresh and VF MNH. These very limited edition promotional "Picture Postage®" stamps were only issued for use on the 2003 season Alaska route cruise ships and are much scarcer than the Unitrade catalogue value would suggest. The 10 undenominated se-tenant stamps in each sheet were (and still are) valid for use as first-class international letter mail. The official printing figures total 50,000 but many were probably still unsold at the end of the cruising season and destroyed. We rarely find these sheets in collections we handle. 2017 Unitrade.	$200.00	$120.00
5360
79	Canada #2299f, 2305f, 2366c. Five complete VF MNH complete sets (still sealed in the original souvenir packs) of the limited edition gold, silver and bronze "Vancouver 2010" overprints in the selvedge of three different Olympic souvenir sheets. A real sleeper set, probably the scarcest of all the Canada 2010 Olympic philatelic issues. Sure to increase in value due to the international appeal of Olympic topicals. 2017 Unitrade.	$325.00	$80.00
5400
80	Canada #2357iii, 2426iii. Scarce VF quality mint uncut press panels of 100 of two different self-adhesive "P" (permanent) die cut coils, consisting of the 2010 issue "Striped Coralroot" and the 2011 issue "Arctic Hare". These uncut panes were in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very scarce modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the two sheets is $170.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2017 Unitrade is not particularly consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. 2017 Unitrade.	$340.00	$210.00
4425
81	Canada #2844. Souvenir Sheet. Recalled 2015 UNESCO World Heritage Sites Souvenir Sheet. VF mint condition example of the scarce recently recalled $6.00 souvenir sheet of five, including one mis-identified "Hoodoo" stamp. The entire printing was withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post. The Unitrade catalogue value is irrelevant with regards to the actual market value of the sheet as the recalled souvenir sheet is proving to be much scarcer than the recalled booklet. Estimate	$150.00	$75.00
5233
82	Canada #B1 // O49. Used "Back of the Book" stock of hundreds of stamps, 19th century to 1970s period issues, all neatly organized in a small red stockbook. The lot includes semi-postals, airmails, special deliveries, registration, postage dues and officials (both overprinted and 4-hole perfins). Expect some faults in the lot but noted shades, wet and dry printings, papers, perfs and a few decent cancels. A great lot for the Back of the Book specialist. Estimate	$120.00	$65.00
5505
83	Canada #BK3d (ENGLISH), BK5f (ENGLISH). Duo of clean KGV Admiral issue booklets, 1c green with sans serif capitals rate sheet (panes stuck to the glassine interleaves) and 2c carmine with small Type II text and overprinted cover. Better condition than is usually found, a very presentable pair of early intact booklets. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$42.00
4350
84	Canada #BK38d. BILINGUAL. Unitrade-listed but still unpriced VF condition 1943 KGVI War Issue "Chewing Gum" format booklet with Type IIa BILINGUAL covers containing panes of 3 of the 1c green, 3c rose violet and 4c dark carmine values. An asterisk in the catalogue notes that "An example has been reported to the editors" and the McCann specialized booklet catalogue has a question mark rather than a value. This lot represents a rare chance for a possibly unique item in pristine condition. Note that this is the same booklet that was offered in sale #1844 and sold for $220.00. The buyer encountered technical difficulties and has chosen to re-sell the item. Estimate	$150.00	$130.00
4462
85	Canada #BK106-BK109. Two complete sets of four VF condition intact mint NH 1989 issue Christmas booklets consisting of the 33c ($3.30), 38c ($3.80), 44c ($2.20) and 76c ($3.80) value booklets. These are a particularly scarce series of booklets, all still sealed. 2017 Unitrade.	$284.00	$50.00
3590
86	Canada #BK111A. VF quality investment group of 10 intact examples of the scarce March 1990 issue 50c Flag booklet, all perf 12.5 x 13 (perf change). 2017 Unitrade.	$500.00	$60.00
5526
87	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$200.00	$80.00
1683
88	Canada #C1 // C8, CE1-CE2. Attractive selection of used blocks of 1928-1943 period airmails and airmail special deliveries. Noted some eye-catching VF multiples in the group. 2017 Scott US$258.70=	$349.25	$46.00
5055
89	Canada #CL4. Pane plus Covers. Archivally fresh and VF mint NH rouletted booklet pane of two of the "Fifth issue" Laurentide Air Service Ltd. semi-official airmail stamp.

Mint NH example of the 1998 issue 45c "John Humphrey" commemorative with horizontal perfs shifted 6mm downwards, resulting in the "CANADA 45" being at the bottom instead of at top of the stamp.

90	Canada #BK74k with varieties. Lot of three different VF mint NH complete and intact QEII 1974 Caricature issue booklets, each booklet containing one pane of #586a, each clearly showing the Re-entry in "age" of "Postage" doubling variety in the 6c value, along with a progressive misperforation variety: the bottom row of stamps measure 23.5, 21.5 and 20.5mm tall for the first, second and third booklet, respectively.

The unsevered booklet of thirty is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $43.20.

269

These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$200.00	$120.00
4554
94	Canada #C1-C9, CE1-CE4, E1-E11, E2a.

High quality recent used commemoratives are quickly becoming increasingly difficult to find.

4057
108	Canada - Used Bundleware Bonanza. Banker's box packed with tens of thousands of used stamps off paper, sorted into bundles of 100 and into glassine envelopes of 100 or 200.

Didn't see any $1.00 values but noted a very high quality throughout with a decent number of CDS cancels in the mix. I don't think that the stamps have been disturbed since they were bundled up 50 to 75 years ago! An untapped goldmine for the semi-modern variety and cancel collector. Estimate	$150.00	$150.00

116	Canada Covers - FDC First Day Covers. Large shoebox packed to the gills with early Canada Post Issue FDCs. A huge accumulation of 940 early CPC issue cachet first day covers from 1972-1974 only. This was the period where Canada Post issued their cachet FDCs using the smaller size envelope before moving over to the large format that is still used today. This lot is the product of years of accumulating these early FDCs, culled from many collections over several years. Since there were only limited issues during this time, there is much duplication in the lot. There is however a good variety of singles, blocks, combinations and plate blocks (noted 150+ plate blocks alone). This group would not amount to a large face value since most of the values were 6c to 8c, but the catalogue value would be huge. Estimated at less than 25c per cover. Estimate	$200.00	$95.00
269
117	Canada Covers - First Day Covers.

4858
119	Canada Covers - Postal Stationery. Collection of 82 Post Office printed stationery envelopes with added stamp show or exhibition cachets.

4858
120	Canada Covers - Ship Mail. Collection of 162 covers 1974-1981, carried aboard a great array of ships operating in Canada or visiting the country. These covers were created by a collector and sent to the ships, each cover is noted with which ship it was on and shows some sort of handstamp (non-philatelic) from the ship which carried it. A huge variety from both the West & East coasts, with many different ship types such as Ferry, Cruise, Navy, Shipping, etc. As an example, some of the ships in BC are the MV Coho, Princess Marguerite, Royal Viking Sky (Cruiseship), SS President Johnson, etc. The majority of the covers are posted to Germany where the collector accumulated them. There are also a dozen or so postcards showing Canadian ships which were not counted. An interesting lot of Canadian ship material, not often offered in any sort of quantity. Estimate	$250.00	$26.00
2050
121	Canada Covers - Yukon, Northern Canada Postal History. Two covers posted at Vancouver BC 1906 to Stewart City, Yukon Territory. A nice duo of incoming covers which were both routed via Whitehorse YT (backstamped) before arriving in Stewart River. Both covers have split ring cancel backstamps of Stewart River. These are fairly early examples as the post office opened in 1902 at Stewart River and closed in 1967 due to limited usefulness. Estimate	$100.00	$36.00
2431
122	Canada Revenues #BCD3. Fresh and VF mint OG Hinged imperforate pair of the 1948 issue $1.00 orange, green & blue BC Conservation "Duck" stamp. A very pretty and rare Provincial revenue variety. Two tiny thins in the upper margin noted for accuracy's sake. 2009 Van Dam.	$600.00	$190.00

5106
124	Canada Revenues #BCH5a, BCH5c. British Columbia Hospital Aid Tax Stamps. Mint examples of two different varieties of the $1.00 black on blue 1933 issue Hospital Aid Tax Stamps.

5416
125	Canada Revenues #BCL46-BCL50. BRITISH COLUMBIA LAW STAMPS. Fresh and VF complete mint Hinged and used sets of five of the 1958 issue BC Centennial series Law stamps. Note that all the stamps in the mint set have full perforations all around as do most of the stamps in the used set (scarce thus, as the panes created mostly straight-edged stamps and Van Dam notes that fully perfed stamps from this series are worth a premium). 2009 Van Dam.	$280.00	$50.00
2168
126	Canada Revenues #BCL48. British Columbia Law Stamp. Three large VF mint NH blocks (36 stamps total) of the 1958 Centennial issue 50c grey (orange and green centre) Provincial Law stamp. 21 of the stamps have perforations on all sides.

5342
147	Canadian Provinces - Prince Edward Island #3. Used example of the 1861 issue 6p yellow green, perf 9 x 9. Usual rough perfs, otherwise lightly cancelled and sound. Rare thus due to the notoriously fragile nature of the paper stock. 2017 Scott US$1,200.00=	$1,620.00	$150.00

The lot contains material from 1950 (#434a), 1965 (#1232a) and then 1977-1999. The booklets in particular have a very high face value "new issue" cost and are often overlooked by collectors.

It has three large to huge even margins and is cancelled by a crisp red Maltese Cross at the upper right. It is cut into very slightly along the top. This stamp shows the "original" Major Re-entry from Plate 1a which shows very bold doubling of the lines of the SW corner square. Stanley Gibbons catalogues this stamp as #1bb at £450.00 because of this very neat Major Re-Entry. Light corner crease at upper right noted for accuracy. 2017 Scott US$320.00=	$432.00	$110.00

The 2017 SG value is £1,900.00 on cover, but that value is for a "cut-square" stamp. The stamp off-cover would not be worthwhile, but the entire is quite pretty.

Valued for the two Unitrade listed varieties only but worth more as a lot. 2017 Unitrade.	$180.00	$140.00

Eyecatching and valuable VF mint NH lot of 1971-1994 issues with misperforation errors in singles, a coil pair and a sheet margin block of 4, especially dramatic with regards to the two Caricature issue examples.

The 2 Christmas stamps, #555 and 557 are both untagged HB paper. All ofher tagging is normal along the perfs. A juicy lot with a varied range of issues not normally offered together. Estimate	$400.00	$230.00

The October 1 issue definitive was delayed repeatedly (from May 6, 1987) due to production difficulties and not released until near the end of the 36c rate period. Thus, this value was current for just three months, during which time the 1987 Christmas stamps would have seen most of the usage. A clean and increasingly scarce investment group. All still in the original Canada Post sealed packaging. 2017 Unitrade.	$400.00	$75.00

5038
86	Canada #1534ii. VF mint NH sheet margin block of four of the unissued 1992 Xmas 52c rate stamp. This stamp was produced for a proposed rate change that was postponed until a later date.

5542
87	Canada #1535ii. VF MNH example of the unissued 90c 1994 Xmas "Carolling". This stamp was prepared for use in anticipation of a rate change that never came about. A few of these 90c values got out accidentally. Only an estimated 1,000 examples were "released". 2017 Unitrade.	$600.00	$375.00

4818
89	Canada #2001d. VF mint NH example of the 2003 issue Canada/Thailand 48c "National Emblems" souvenir sheet, COMPLETELY IMPERFORATE. A true modern era error rarity, as only a couple of imperf sheets have been found to date. 2017 Unitrade.	$2,000.00	$575.00

Conservatively valued for the useable face value alone. Total face value	$268.27	$230.00
4671
91	Canada #2357iii, 2426iii. Scarce VF quality mint uncut press panels of 100 of two different self-adhesive "P" (permanent) die cut coils, consisting of the 2010 issue "Striped Coralroot" and the 2011 issue "Arctic Hare". These uncut panes were in very limited numbers. This particular sheet format creates horizontal pairs of stamps that are imperforate between. These are very scarce modern varieties, as most collectors were not made aware of this particular format. The present face value of the two sheets is $170.00 (but worth more). The pricing in the 2017 Unitrade is not particularly consistent with the actual scarcity of these limited issue sheets. 2017 Unitrade.	$340.00	$300.00
4295
92	Canada #BK34a (French) and BK34d (French). Two 1942 War Issue booklets, each containing 2 panes of the 3c carmine (#251a).

93	Canada #BK38b // BK605, cc8710. Booklets. Small box stuffed with a total of 201 VF MNH complete and intact booklets, 1943 to 2014 period, consisting of a huge range of issues with light duplication to be expected in places. Generally VF condition, some counting marks noted but not valued with a premium, unchecked for paper types and plate varieties, in which there is most likely much value. Also of note is a very unusual complete 1939 Canadian Post Office Department booklet containing 5 rouletted panes of 6 Air Mail labels, listed in Lafreniere's Cinderella Field Guide as cc8710 at $25.00 per pane (not valued as a complete booklet). 2017 Unitrade $1,135.75 (plus $125 for the Air Mail labels)=	$1,260.75	$375.00

An asterisk in the catalogue notes that "An example has been reported to the editors" and the McCann specialized booklet catalogue has a question mark rather than a value. This lot represents a rare chance for a possibly unique item in pristine condition. Estimate	$150.00	$220.00
3208
95	Canada #BK62 // BK145. Varied and useful study/collection/selection of 250 complete and intact VF mint condition booklets, 1970 to 1992 period issues.

Of particular note are detailed studies of #BK70 and #BK81 with lots of Unitrade listed and unlisted items. All nicely laid out on stockpages with many of the booklets described in detail.

4818
96	Canada #BK118. Wholesale lot of 20 complete mint NH $9.75 "Moving the Mail" booklets, a 1990 issue "Prestige" style booklet containing 25 x 39c Canada Post Mail Van commemoratives, all laid out in various combinations (inward and outward facing vans). A very useful lot for retailing, as these booklets are scarce. Total face value of all 20 booklets is $195.00. 2017 Unitrade.	$640.00	$120.00
2299
97	Canada #BK251Aa.

There was a very limited issue of this overprint (the overprinted stamp was NOT included in the Annual Collection or quarterly pack). This unsevered booklet of thirty (#1991b) is the only way to get the complete Post Office cover design, as the photograph pf the Post Office building runs across all three booklets of ten. Total face value as postage is $72.00. A "sleeper" booklet type and scarce Olympic topical. 2017 Unitrade.	$300.00	$95.00
3613
98	Canada #BK623. Hoodoos Booklets. Two 2015 issue UNESCO World Heritage Sites Booklets. Both in VF mint condition. These examples of the rare recently recalled $7.20 self-adhesive booklet of six x $1.20 stamps each include two of the mis-identified "Hoodoos" stamps. Withdrawn from post offices in a panic by Canada Post, not many reached private hands. This booklet duo will be perfect for exhibition and display, as the wrong "Hoodoo" is also illustrated on the booklet cover. Estimate	$200.00	$130.00
3208
